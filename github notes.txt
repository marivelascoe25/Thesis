Clone empty repositories:
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Adding changes in git bash: go to folder first through "cd folder"
- git pull: pull the changes from github
- git add . : add all changes made locally
- git commit -m "this is what I did to the code": commit with a note 
- git push: push the new code to the github


If you have changed in the files but you want to get the version from github without your changes: 
git add .
git stash
git pull
