\section{Organic Semiconductors}

\subsection{Electronic structure}
Since inorganic semiconductors' band theory does not take into consideration the Coulomb and exchange electron-electron interaction, which play a major role in organic semiconductors, it is necessary to add new theoretical approaches. On one hand, the transport properties are better described in terms of a hopping mechanism and the optoelectronic properties are better described by the molecular orbital picture. \nocite{alcacer_electronic_2018}
