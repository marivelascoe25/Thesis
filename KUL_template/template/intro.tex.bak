\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

The field of organic electronics has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, with organic electronic devices exhibiting promising characteristics for various applications. One key component of these devices is the Organic Electrochemical Transistor (OECT), which has attracted considerable attention due to its unique capabilties and potential for use in biosensors, energy storage and neuromorphic devices. The OECT's operation relies on the modulation of its threshold voltage, which determines its switching behavior and performance.

Explain the progress on the design in new conjugated polymers for enhancement-mode OECTs.

\section{Motivation}
The ability to precisely control and tune threshold voltage of an OECT is of great importance in reducing power consumption, optimizing device performance and expanding their applications. By manipulating the doping level of the conjugated polymer p(g3T2-T), we can potentially achieve significant shifts in the threshold voltage, leading to improved device characteristics such as sensitivity, response time, and stability. Understanding the relationship between the doping level and threshold voltage shift is crucial for the design and fabrication of high performance OECTs.

\section{Goal}
The primary objective of this research is to investigate and characterize the tuning of the threshold voltage of an OECT by varying the doping level of the conjugated polymer p(g3T2-T). Specifically, we aim to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Synthetize and characteriye p(g3T2-T) with varying doping levels: This envolves chemically modified the conjugated polymer with different concentrations of dopant and analyzing their structural and electrical properties using techniquies such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV).
\item Fabricate OECT devices: Utilizing the synthetized polymer, we will design and fabricate OECT devices through a combination of electrode patterning techniques, material deposition, lithography and inkjet printing. The devices will be carefully optimized to ensure reproducibility and stability. 
\item Investigate the shift in threshold voltage: through electrical characterization, we will measure the threshold voltage of the fabricated OECT devices with varying doping levels of p(g3T2-T) and the resulting threshold voltage shift.
\item Assess device stability: to evaluate stability of the OET devices, we will perform long-term measurements and examine the changes in their threshold voltage over time. This analysis will provide insights into the durability and reliability of the devices, essential for practical applications.
