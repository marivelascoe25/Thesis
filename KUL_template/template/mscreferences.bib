	title = {Organic electrochemical transistors with solid-state electrolytes},
	abstract = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent a class of electronic devices that received increasing attention in recent years. Their unique working mechanism, which is defined by the interplay of electronic and ionic charge carriers, gives them in inherent similarity to biological synapses and thus renders the devices highly appealing for neuromorphic computing. While OECTs reported in literature are mostly employing aqueous electrolytes, this work focuses on newly developed systems with solid-state electrolytes, which are based on an ionic liquid and that should greatly facilitate applications.
This thesis presents very promising electrical characteristics for these novel devices in terms of low threshold voltages ({\textless} 0.3V), high on/off-ratios (∼ 105), and maximum transconductance around 0V. Transfer curves were also found to exhibit remarkably large hysteresis, which is
typically a drawback of transistor devices. However, here it represents an attractive feature for the particular applications sought. On the downside though, the devices also feature channel degradation and irreproducibility under ambient conditions. A new quantification method for hysteresis is introduced that allows to compare its relative extent through a parameter ψ, which also denotes the progress direction through its sign. Interface experiments indicate that the commonly recognised understanding of OECTs cannot be directly transferred to systems with solid-state electrolytes, of which the electrical characteristics could be rendered reproducible under inert conditions. This prerequisite allowed to identify hysteresis as a constant and reliable property of transfer characteristics, which appears to saturate above a certain gate bias and may potentially be based on coexisting equilibrium states. The suspicion that different mechanisms
than originally assumed are involved was further substantiated by experiments with modified channels and exchanged electrolytes. These studies revealed that not only is the ionic liquid not decisive for the gating process, but moreover that external ion sources in general are not required for operating the OECT. It is suspected that the underlying mechanisms are based on inherently included sodium ions in the channel material PEDOT:PSS, which were proven to be
approximately a hundred times higher concentrated as specified by the supplier ({\textgreater} 7000 ppm found). This insight allowed to interpret the outcome of investigations on the potential drop in PEDOT:PSS under various electrolytes. The comparison of devices with altered channel
thicknesses revealed that different response times account for different extents of hysteresis, which was confirmed by its decrease for slower scan rates. However, it was also found that the hysteresis cannot be completely suppressed, which is considered a strong indicator of a bistable equilibrium state based on other than purely kinetic processes.},

	title = {Doping {Properties} of {Novel} {Dopants} for {Organic} {Hole} {Transport} {Layers}},
	abstract = {A new class of dopant materials for organic hole transport layers, developed by the TU-Dresden spin-off project Credoxys, is investigated in this thesis. These dopants show an advantage regarding the absorption in the visible and near infrared range.
Here, no parasitic absorption by dopant radical anions is detected. The focus is to study the doping efficiency and absorption of thin films doped with these materials.
The mainly utilized host material was MeO-TPD, which is a common hole transport material. F6-TCNNQ serves as reference dopant, since it is an efficient dopant. Both materials are well-characterized in several scientific studies. As representative of the new materials, a prototype dopant (CDX-A) and a further developed dopant (CDX-B), are investigated. It is shown that both dopants are capable of doping MeO-TPD. Thereby, conductivity values of up to 2.25 · 10−4 S/cm
are achieved for MeO-TPD:CDX-B at a dopant concentration of 8 mol\%, while MeO-TPD:F6-TCNNQ exhibits only 1.66 · 10−4 S/cm.
By using impedance spectroscopy, doping efficiencies of 0.17 and 0.66 are determined for CDX-A and CDX-B in MeO-TPD at a dopant concentration of 1.7 mol\%. Thus, CDX-B yields a slightly worse result than F6-TCNNQ, which has a doping efficiency of 0.79 at the same dopant concentration. Because of additional trap states in the layers doped by CDX-A, which is detected with impedance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy is performed. The aim is to clarify whether the ligands of CDX-A are separated during the doping process,
which could be the origin of the additional trap states. However, it is not possible to confirm this theory, since the spectrum of the ligands is largely consistent with that of CDX-A.
Finally, also ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy of MeO-TPD doped by CDX-A is made. A shift in the chemical potential is confirmed.},

“We tuned the mechanical and chemical properties of the solid electrolyte: the amount of MBAm directly influences the mechanical stability of the solid electrolyte as well as the gel’s ability to swell in the IL.24 We optimized the solid electrolyte to show good mechanical stability as well as sufficient swelling and found the optimal crosslinker-to-monomer ratio to be 1 : 50. A higher concentration leads to a too rigid matrix, incapable of dissolving the IL. Conversely, too little crosslinker results in a mechanically unstable gel that washes away upon development.” (Weissbach et al., 2022, p. 2658)“When not patterned, two issues are limiting the OECT performance and integration: at the single-device level, a high gate current limits the off-state of the transistor and hence its on–off ratio” (Weissbach et al., 2022, p. 2658)“More importantly from an integration standpoint, a non-patterned electrolyte creates communication between adjacent devices which cannot operate simultaneously.” (Weissbach et al., 2022, p. 2658)“By increasing the gate voltage, the amount of oxidized PEDOT is lowered and so is the drain current” (Weissbach et al., 2022, p. 2658)“we conclude that humidity swells the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS and allows ion movement within the channel. For this particular reason, water is a mandatory component of the solid electrolyte’s precursor solution.” (Weissbach et al., 2022, p. 2659)“The root of an increasing c in the first regime is found in the switching speed of the transistor: the electronic elements used to model the circuit, the electrolyte resistance (RSE) and the channel capacitance CCh, cause a latency of the device to an applied bias, since the capacitor needs to charge through the resistor. The associated time constant is the RC time tRC, which is defined as the product of electrolyte resistance and double layer capacitance.” (Weissbach et al., 2022, p. 2661)“we conclude that the increase in hysteresis of regime I is the result of scan rates exceeding tRC, which accordingly do not switch the device entirely and thus yield a small hysteresis.” (Weissbach et al., 2022, p. 2661)“Transistors with thicker channel and hence larger tRC indeed show smaller hysteresis at high scan rates (regime I)” (Weissbach et al., 2022, p. 2661)

With the increased popularity of OECTs in bioelectronics applications and to benchmark mixed conduction properties of channel materials, the characterization methods have broadened somewhat heterogeneously. We intend this review to be a guide for the characterization methods of the OECT and the channel materials used. Our review is composed of two main sections. First, we review techniques to fabricate the OECT, introduce different form factors and configurations, and describe the device operation principle. We then discuss the OECT performance figures of merit and detail the experimental procedures to obtain these characteristics. In the second section, we shed light on the characterization of mixed transport properties of channel materials and describe how to assess films' interactions with aqueous electrolytes. In particular, we introduce experimental methods to monitor ion motion and diffusion, charge carrier mobility, and water uptake in the films. We also discuss a few theoretical models describing ion-polymer interactions. We hope that the guidelines we bring together in this review will help researchers perform a more comprehensive and consistent comparison of new materials and device designs, and they will be used to identify advances and opportunities to improve the device performance, progressing the field of organic bioelectronics.},

	abstract = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have shown promise as transducers and amplifiers of minute electronic potentials due to their large transconductances. Tuning the OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low-powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics, such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, simple solution-processing methods are utilized to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of the OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air-sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, OECTs that are simultaneously low-powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions under ambient conditions are demonstrated. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which is once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.},

We found out that the addition of CB impacted the crystallites, transforming their molecular orientation from face-on to edge-on. We reason that the edge-on chain orientation toward the substrate would facilitate in-plane charge transport, where the tighter lamellar packing shortens the path for charge hopping. Incontrast, BCF affected both the amorphous content, deduced from the changes observed in AFM images, and the crystalline content, which despite the similar π-stacking distances sees an increase in lamellar spacing. BCF endowed devices with long-term operational stability, and this seems to be due to a reorganization ofthe amorphous content. The extra space in between lamellae may allow for the ions tomore readily access the bulk of the film without necessarily affecting the morphology, resulting in similar current modulation over several cycles. Nevertheless, neither of the additives led to devices with high gm that remains over several days with successive switch on and off cycles.” (Hidalgo Castillo et al., 2022, p. 6729)“For all cases, BCF generates afibrillar film morphology (Figure 4a), with ahigher overall roughness (Figure 4b) compared tothe pristine and CB-only films.” (Hidalgo Castillo et al., 2022, p. 6730)},

Each dopant molecule is commonly thought to give rise to only one polaron, leading to a maximum of one donor:acceptor charge-transfer complex and hence an ionization efficiency of 100\%. However, this theoretical limit is rarely achieved because of incomplete charge transfer and the presence of unreacted dopant. Here, we establish that common p-dopants can in fact accept two electrons per molecule from conjugated polymers with a low ionization energy. Each dopant molecule participates in two charge-transfer events, leading to the formation of dopant dianions and an ionization efficiency of up to 200\%. Furthermore, we show that the resulting integer charge-transfer complex can dissociate with an efficiency of up to 170\%. The concept of double doping introduced here may allow the dopant fraction required to optimize charge conduction to be halved.},

	abstract = {Tailoring organic semiconductors to facilitate mixed conduction of ionic and electronic charges when interfaced with an aqueous media has spurred many recent advances in organic bioelectronics. The field is still restricted, however, by very few n-type (electron-transporting) organic semiconductors with adequate performance metrics. Here, a new electron-deficient, fused polycyclic aromatic system, TNR, is reported with excellent n-type mixed conduction properties including a µC* figure-of-merit value exceeding 30 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for the best performing derivative. Comprising three naphthalene bis-isatin moieties, this new molecular design builds on successful small-molecule mixed conductors; by extending the molecular scaffold into the oligomer domain, good film-forming properties, strong π–π interactions, and consequently excellent charge-transport properties are obtained. Through judicious optimization of the side chains, the linear oligoether and branched alkyl chain derivative bgTNR is obtained which shows superior mixed conduction in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration including an electron mobility around 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1. By optimizing the side chains, the dominant molecular packing can be changed from a preferential edge-on orientation (with high charge-transport anisotropy) to an oblique orientation that can support 3D transport pathways which in turn ensure highly efficient mixed conduction properties across the bulk semiconductor film.},

Here we demonstrate an organic nanocomposite that spontaneously forms when mixing an organic semiconductor with an ionic liquid and exhibits efficient room-temperature mixed conduction. We use a polymer known to form a semicrystalline microstructure to template ion intercalation into the side-chain domains of the crystallites, which leaves electronic transport pathways intact. Thus, the resulting material is ordered, exhibiting alternating layers of rigid semiconducting sheets and soft ion-conducting layers. This unique dual-network microstructure leads to a dynamic ionic/electronic nanocomposite with liquid-like ionic transport and highly mobile electronic charges. Using a combination of operando X-ray scattering and in situ spectroscopy, we confirm the ordered structure of the nanocomposite and uncover the mechanisms that give rise to efficient electron transport. These results provide fundamental insights into charge transport in organic semiconductors, as well as suggesting a pathway towards future improvements in these nanocomposites.},

Herein, three fluorinated alcohols (FAs), including 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), and perfluoro-tert-butanol (PFTB), were employed as the alternative solvents for engineering the n-type small-molecule active layer gNR. Remarkedly, an impressive μC* of 5.12 F V–1 cm–1 s–1 and a normalized transconductance of 1.216 S cm–1 are achieved from the HFIP-fabricated gNR OECTs, which is three times higher than that of chloroform. The operational stability has been significantly enhanced by the FA-fabricated devices. Such enhancements can be ascribed to the aggregation-induced structural ordering by FAs during spin coating, which optimizes the microstructure of the films for a better mixed ion and electron transport. These results prove the huge research potential of FAs to improve OECT materials’ processability, device performance, and stability, therefore promoting practical bio-applications.},

	abstract = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) composed of organic mixed conductors can operate in aqueous, biological media and translate low-magnitude ionic fluctuations of biological origin into measurable electrical signals. The growing technological interest in these biotransducers makes the fundamental understanding of ion-to-electron coupling extremely important for the design of new materials and devices. One crucial aspect in this process that has been so far disregarded is the water taken up by the film during device operation and its effects on device performance. Here, using a series of the same electrolyte with varying ion concentrations, we quantify the amount of water that is incorporated into a hydrophilic p-type organic semiconductor film alongside the dopant anions and investigate structural and morphological changes occurring in the film upon electrochemical doping. We show that infiltration of the hydrated dopant ions into the film irreversibly changes the polymer structure and negatively impacts the efficiency, reversibility, and speed of charge generation. When less water is injected into the channel, OECTs exhibit higher transconductance and faster switching speeds. Although swelling is commonly suggested to be a necessity for efficient ion-to-electron transduction, this work uncovers the negative impact of a swollen channel material on the performance of accumulation mode OECTs and lays the foundation for future materials design.},

Organic field-effect transistors have the potential to be the basic device for flexible electronics, but still need much improvement. In particular, despite more than 20 years of research, organic inversion mode transistors have not been reported so far. Here we discuss the first realization of organic inversion transistors and the optimization of organic depletion transistors by our organic doping technology. We show that the transistor parameters—in particular, the threshold voltage and the ON/OFF ratio—can be controlled by the doping concentration and the thickness of the transistor channel. Injection of minority carriers into the doped transistor channel is achieved by doped contacts, which allows forming an inversion layer.},

In contrast to previous studies that compared the air stability of doped films with the energy levels of neat host or dopant layers, we trace back the varying degree of air sensitivity to the energy levels of integer charge transfer states (ICTCs) formed by host anions and dopant cations. Our data indicate a universal limit for the ionization energy of ICTCs above which the n-doped semiconductors are air-stable.},

This enables analyzing the OECTs electrical performance as well as a simplified chemical properties via an electrical double layer, doping and de-doping of the OMIEC layer.

Quantitative analysis of CM spectra of doped P3HT show that dopants induce measurable changes in the P3HT local chain conformation. We find that the dopants reside in both the aggregate and amorphous regions of the polymer, not just in the amorphous regions, as previously assumed. With increased doping, the P3HT intrachain disorder grows, causing the P3HT chains to become more oligomer-like, which we postulate leads to the drop in mobility commonly observed in literature.},

	abstract = {The field of organic electronics thrives on the hope of enabling low-cost, solution-processed electronic devices with mechanical, optoelectronic, and chemical properties not available from inorganic semiconductors. A key to the success of these aspirations is the ability to controllably dope organic semiconductors with high spatial resolution. Here, recent progress in molecular doping of organic semiconductors is summarized, with an emphasis on solution-processed p-type doped polymeric semiconductors. Highlighted topics include how solution-processing techniques can control the distribution, diffusion, and density of dopants within the organic semiconductor, and, in turn, affect the electronic properties of the material. Research in these areas has recently intensified, thanks to advances in chemical synthesis, improved understanding of charged states in organic materials, and a focus on relating fabrication techniques to morphology. Significant disorder in these systems, along with complex interactions between doping and film morphology, is often responsible for charge trapping and low doping efficiency. However, the strong coupling between doping, solubility, and morphology can be harnessed to control crystallinity, create doping gradients, and pattern polymers. These breakthroughs suggest a role for molecular doping not only in device function but also in fabrication—applications beyond those directly analogous to inorganic doping.},

	abstract = {Conjugated copolymers consisting of alternating donor and acceptor units play a prominent role in organic electronics, as their properties can be flexibly adapted to the respective field of application by chemical modifications and exchange of donors or acceptors. A prerequisite for understanding how these materials function is a deep knowledge of their structure-function relationships. This requires methods with a molecular resolution. TREPR spectroscopy in particular is suitable for investigating the electronic structure and morphology of these materials. In this work, DFT calculations were carried out in addition and necessary evaluation routines were developed. First, the electronic structure and morphology of the polymer PCDTBT and fragments of different lengths were investigated. Based on these results, the influence of additional hexyl 
side chains was investigated in detail. For the dominant unit TBT, triplet formation pathways could be elucidated, in particular the direct excitation from the singlet ground state into the triplet state. Furthermore, by linking TBT with the already known acceptor NDI, the influence of two competing acceptors on the electronic structure was detected. Finally, two potential repeat units, NDI-T2 and T-NDI-T, were investigated for the polymer PNDIT2 and NDI-T2 was unequivocally identified as the dominant chromophore in the polymer.},

	abstract = {The development of wearable devices for continuous health monitoring of biomarkers requires materials that are mechanically compliant, biocompatible, and are sensitive to biochemical molecules. One class of materials that show promise are Organic Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors (OMIECs), commonly semiconducting polymers, which are redoxactive and can simultaneously conduct ions and electrons. Electronic charges accumulated on the conjugated polymer backbone result in secondary property changes in electrochemical potential and electronic conductivity, allowing OMIECs to be implemented in a variety of devices such as chemical sensors, organic electrochemical transistors, and energy storage electrodes. Additionally, the mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility of these polymers enable conformable and seamless integration with biological interfaces, enabling bio-interfacing devices for continuous health monitoring. My PhD research investigates how OMIECs can be designed, characterized, and implemented in 1) polymer-based batteries for energy storage, 2) electrochemical sensors for the detection of biological analytes, 3) organic electrochemical transistors that amplify biosensing signals, and 4) tunable antennas for wireless signal transmission in microwave frequencies compatible with consumer electronics. Leveraging fundamental materials characterization to drive the understanding of device physics, these OMIEC-based technologies are integrated into a fully self-powered and wireless glucose sensor.},
