%\section{Photomasks}
%Photomasks were employed during photolithography to cover or uncover the respective areas of interest, depending on the photoresist employed (positive or negative, respectively). Details are given in Chapter . The employed photomasks for OECT fabrication are shown in Figure , with a labeled close-up scheme of a transistor device given in Figure . All devices were designed in a side-gate structure with the 16 devices each mask comprised differing in channel length and gate distance. An overview of the specific dimensions is provided in Table  with the designations assigning the devices (U1 – U8 (Up) and D1 – D8 (Down)). Since investigations on device dimensions were not a direct study object of this work, according assignments were left out. However, all comparisons between different substrates do of course always refer to the very same devices on each individual sample. A device assignment of all plots shown is given in Table S1. It shall be pointed out that the fabrication process did regularly lead to samples with several non-functioning devices. Accordingly, experiments were to be conducted on OECTs that were found working, which accounts for the variation in examined devices. For experiments of Chapter , available photomasks were arranged and covered to yield the setup shown in Figure . For experiments of Chapter , channels of p(g3T2-T) with underlying gold contacts were prepared. The corresponding photomasks are shown in Figure  and were printed on plastic foil in a common inkjet printer. As schematically shown in Figure  though, the lower big as well as several small gold contacts have not been used during execution. The lowest small gold contact served as source electrode.

\section{Experimental Procedures}

All fabrication steps were performed under standard cleanroom conditions.
\subsection{Preparation of films}
\paragraph{Dynamic spin-coating of p(g3T2-T).}Unlike reference \cite{tanTuningOrganicElectrochemical2022}, in which drop cast is used to deposit undoped and doped p(g3T2-T), in order to perform photolithography and being able to do a miniaturization process, homogeneous films are needed. Dynamic spin-coating was previously stablished by BioSens group members at IAPP, due to the high volatility of p(g3T2-T) solvant: chloroform. Substrates were cleaned using subsequent steps of ultrasonic bath with acetone for 15 minutes, IPA rinsing, N$_{2}$ drying and O$_{2}$-plasma cleaning. Then, 70$\mu$L of 10 mg/mL of p(g3T2-T) mixed at 60$^{\circ}$C for 20 minutes, was dynamic-spin-coated at 3000 RPM for 60s, to yield approximately 70nm-thick films. Dry sample at 80$^{\circ}$C.

\paragraph{Dynamic spin-coating of F$_{4}$TCNQ dopant.}Different doping levels of p(g3T2-T) was achieved by dynamic spin-coating 140$\mu$L of dopants at different concentrations (5, 10 and 20 mg/mL), previously mixed in acetronitrile at $60^{\circ}$C for 20 minutes. Dry sample at 80$^{\circ}$C.

  \caption{Dynamic spin coating process to obtain undoped and doped films of p(g3T2-T)).}
  \label{fig:coating}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Doping characterization of films}

\paragraph{UV-Vis-NIR Spectroscopy.}After the preparation of the films, Transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) was measured using the UV-Vis-NIR Spectrometer in the range of 285 to 1600 nm, and slit width of 5,0 nm. Then absorption (A) was calculated via


\begin{equation}\label{eq:abs}
	A = 1 - T - R,
\end{equation}

normalized with respect to the incoming light. Additional measurements were taken, after some days of storage under ambient conditions to check its stability on air.

\paragraph{Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy.}After the preparation of the films (air exposure) the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital cutoff (E$_{HOMO}$) and the high binding energy cutoff E$_{HBEC}$ was measuring using UPS. The pressure in the chamber during measurements was about 5$\cdot$10$^{-9}$ mbar, while the base pressure is in the range of 10$\cdot$10$^{-10}$ mbar. The workfunction (WF) and ionization energy (IE) are given by the following equations:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:wf}
	WF = h\nu - E_{HBEC},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ie}
	IE = h\nu - (E_{HBEC}-E_{HOMO}),
\end{equation}

where $h\nu = 21.22 eV$, the main He I excitation line \cite{buchholtzDopingPropertiesNovel2021}. 

\paragraph{Profilometer.}The films were scratched 4 times to remove part of material, and measure the cavity dept to obtain the film thickness.

\paragraph{Van Der Pauw.}Sheet resistance was calculated via

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rs}
	R_{S} = \frac{\pi}{ln(2)}R = 4,53 R \, [\Omega/sq],
\end{equation}

where R is the resistance measured with the four-point probe setup and resistivity was calculated using the following equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:resist}
	\rho = R_{s}t \, [\Omega.cm],
\end{equation}

\subsection{Fabrication of Organic Electrochemical Transistors}

\subsubsection{Influence of doping OECT channel} \label{subsec:photo}

Photolitographically patterned substrates with gold contacts for source, drain and gate were obtained following references \cite{weissbachPhotopatternableSolidElectrolyte2022} \cite{bongartzOrganicElectrochemicalTransistors2021}, described in Figure \ref{fig:aupat}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\label{fig:aupat}
\end{figure}

Then p(g3T2-T) films were deposited following the procedure described in previous section. The patterning of channel follow a similar procedure from the same reference where PEDOT:PSS is being used, with some modifications in the exposure and developing times. However, if the undoped-p(g3T2-T) is being used, the protocol needs the addition of a sacrificial layer to ensure cross-linking. Both processes are described in the following:

\paragraph{Patterning undoped p(g3T2-T)}Patterning of the p(g3T2-T) was achieved with photolithography, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:undopedpat}, first a fluoropolymer Sacrificial Layer 1 was spin coated at 6000 RPM for 60 s, followed by a baking step for 60 s at $113^{\circ}$C. Before the deposition of photoresist, a 60 s-plasma treatment was applied from UFO2 to promote adhesion. Then, NLOF 2020 was spin coated at 3000 RPM for 60 s and baked for another 60 s at $113^{\circ}$C. Exposure of negative resist was performed for 12 s with shadowing all areas except the ones of interest. After post-baking for 60 s at $113^{\circ}$C, NLOF was developed by rinsing the sample in AZ MIF 726 for 20 s and wash off in DI water (carried out extra times if necessary). Next, SL1 was developed using HF 7300 developer for 20 s and spin rinsed at 3000 RPM (carried out extra times if necessary). Excess of p(g3T2-T) was removed by O$_{2}$-plasma etching for 180 s. The sample was placed in Orthogonal Stripper 900 overnight at room temperature, to complete removal, ultrasonication in acetone was added for 15 min the next day.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Patterning doped-p(g3T2-T)}Patterning of the doped-p(g3T2-T) was achieved with photolithography, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dopedpat}, first the orthogonal photoresist OSCoR 4020 was spin coated at 3000 RPM for 60 s and baked for another 60 s at $103^{\circ}$C. Exposure of negative resist was performed for 20 s with shadowing all areas except the ones of interest, one extra cycle was added if using higher dopant concentration (10 mg/mL). After post-baking for 60 s at $103^{\circ}$C, OSCoR was developed using Orthogonal Developer 103a for 50 s and spin rinsed at 3000 RPM for 60 s (carried out extra times if necessary). Excess of doped-p(g3T2-T) was removed by O$_{2}$-plasma etching for 180 s. The sample was placed in Orthogonal Stripper 900 overnight at room temperature.

\paragraph{OECT with undoped and doped p(g3T2-T) channel.} A solid-state electrolyte precursor was prepared, as describe in Table \ref{tab:sse}, and 20$\mu$L was dropcasted to the patterned samples (undoped and doped) covering all 14 devices. Finally, a Ag/AgCl pellet was installed and used as gate (Figure \ref{fig:biosetup}). Transfer characteristics were measured under ambient conditions with different source-drain voltages (V$_{DS}$= -0.1, -0.2, -0.5V).

\subsubsection{Stability on air of p(g3T2-T)}
In this subsection, the stability of undoped and doped samples of p(g3T2-T) (here F$_{6}$TCNNQ is being used) in N$_{2}$ and ambient conditions were tested at different stages of the photolithography process by measuring the channel conductivity under a fixed biased drain-source voltage. %, upon spin-coating, patterning, i) upon dropcast of solid-state electrolyte precursor, and after exposure, ii) after photopatterned solid-state electrolyte, and finally

\paragraph{Channel conductivity measurements.}Undoped-p(g3T2-T) were measured in N$_{2}$ and ambient conditions immediately after spin-coating onto substrate with patterned gold contacts. Then, they were measured after patterning process (as described in previous section). Finally, upon drop-casting solid-state electrolyte precursor. Doped-p(g3T2-T) channel was measured after patterning and upon drop-casting solid-state electrolyte precursor.

\subsubsection{Reverse oxidation of undoped p(g3T2-T)}

\paragraph{By electrochemical dedoping.}Undoped-p(g3T2-T) samples onto patterned-gold-contacts substrates were prepared. The solid-state-electrolyte precursor was dropcast onto the 14 devices, one device source-drain was biased (-0.3V) and applied a positive gate voltage (+1V). Channel conductivity was monitored. Finally, other devices in the sample were measured to detect any effect of the process.

\paragraph{By heating.}An undoped-p(g3T2-T) solid-OECT, whose fabrication will be described in the following subsection (\ref{subsec:solidOECT}), was exposed to ambient conditions, devices were clearly oxidized. The sample was placed in a hot plate at 120$^{\circ}$C, brought back to glovebox, and measure the following day.  %\cite{weissbachPhotopatternableSolidElectrolyte2022}.
