  I would like to thank everybody who kept me busy the last year,
  especially my promoter and my assistants. I would also like to thank the
  jury for reading the text. My sincere gratitude also goes to my wive and

\begin{abstract}
Organic Electrochemical transistors (OECTs) exhibit advantageous properties, such as high transconductance and steep-slope switching, while operating at very low voltages. Although, their switching speed is comparatively slower than solid-state devices, it remains sufficient for applications in bioelectronics \cite{rivnay_organic_2018}. The gold standard for p-type OECT devices is PEDOT:PSS. However, its main drawback lies in its depletion-mode operation, which requires power to turn off the device. To minimize power consumption and improve stability, efforts have been made to the design semiconducting polymers that allow accumulation-mode devices. One such polymer, 3-(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)thiophene (p(g3T2-T)) has demonstrated threshold voltages close to zero and high transconductance \cite{nielsen_molecular_2016}. Furthermore, by doping p(g3T2-T) at various levels and drop-casting it as a gate, it has been possible to fine-tune the threshold voltage \cite{tan_tuning_2022}. This study aims to adapt a microstructuring method for fabricating OECT devices that incorporate a solid electrolyte \cite{weissbach_photopatternable_2022} along with different doping levels of p(g3T2-T). Additionally, the study aims to adjust the threshold voltage by utilizing these varying doping levels.
