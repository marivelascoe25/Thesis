\begin{abstract}
Organic Electrochemical Transistors (OECTs) exhibit advantageous properties, such as high transconductance and steep-slope switching, while operating at very low voltages. Although, their switching speed is comparatively slower than solid-state devices, it remains sufficient for applications in bioelectronics \cite{rivnayOrganicElectrochemicalTransistors2018}. The gold standard conjugated polymer for p-type OECTs is PEDOT:PSS. However, its main drawback lies in its depletion-mode operation, which requires power to turn off the device. To minimize power consumption and improve stability, efforts have been made to the design conjugated polymers that allow accumulation-mode devices. One such polymer, 3-(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)thiophene (p(g3T2-T)) has demonstrated negative threshold voltages close to zero and high transconductance \cite{nielsenMolecularDesignSemiconducting2016}. Furthermore, by doping p(g3T2-T) at various levels and drop-casting it as a gate, it has been possible to fine-tune the threshold voltage \cite{tanTuningOrganicElectrochemical2022}. This study aims to adapt a microstructuring method for fabricating side-gated OECT devices that comprise different doping levels of F$_{4}$TCNQ and F$_{6}$TCNNQ in p(g3T2-T) and a solid-state electrolyte \cite{weissbachPhotopatternableSolidElectrolyte2022}, the latter is deposited by inkjet printing. Additionally, the study aims to adjust the threshold voltage by utilizing these varying doping levels, while analyzing the stability and performance of the doped devices.
