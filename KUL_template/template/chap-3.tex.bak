\section{Doping characterization}

Upon increase of the dopant concentration that is deposited and bake on top of the p(g3T2-T) film, the reflection hue, as observed in Figure \ref{fig:color} shift towards more yellowish colors.

\subsection{Absorbance and dopants diffusion}
The visible color hue shift can be described quasi-quantitatively by the absorbance spectra of the samples, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:abs}, where the undoped-p(g3T2-T) shows a prominent absorption peak at 588 nm (red), which diminishes with doping, characteristic from oxidation, and it is more intense with higher doping levels. New absorption peaks are seen at around 860 nm, this is due to generation of polarons that lead to new optical transitions, as explained in section... from the Background chapter. Tan et al. described the apparition of new absorption peaks within 300 to 600 nm, the higher energetic (lower wavelength) one is generated by unreacted neutral dopant species (TCNQ$^{0}$), while the second is due to the new dopant anions (TCNQ$^{-}$), the latter induce charges in our polymer \cite{tanTuningOrganicElectrochemical2022}. It is shown also, that after some days of storage, the initially dominant peak of unreacted neutral dopants is now lower in intensity than the anions peak, suggesting that the dopants were still diffusing through the polymer along the days.

\end{figure}

Absorbance values are directly linked to the density of states of these new optical transitions \cite{bredasPolaronsBipolaronsSolitons1985}. From our spectra, the absorption value of the lowest doped-p(g3T2-T) (5 mg/mL) is higher (around 40\%), which may be counter-intuitive. However, as doping concentration increases, hence more electrons are taken out of the polymer chain, a bipolar is the energetically more favorable quasiparticle to generate. According to reference \cite{tanTuningOrganicElectrochemical2022}\cite{enenglDopinginducedAbsorptionBands2016}, bipolaron formation is seen as a shift to lower energies in the broad absorbance the mid-IR region (wavenumber 1000-1600 cm$^{-1}$) so further analysis of hole bipolaron formation can be conducted with Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy.
 
\subsection{Workfunction}

Although, some air exposure and contamination was not possible to be avoid during the preparation of the films, it is possible to distinguish an increase in the workfunction (shift of Fermi level) of the polymer. The Fermi level shift towards the HOMO level is higher at higher dopant levels, as represented in Figure \ref{fig:ups}, characteristic of p-type doping. Some possible contamination did not allow to measure sample with 20 mg/mL of dopant.

\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{Workfunction calculation from UPS measurements.}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c}
& Undoped & 5 mg/mL & 10 mg/mL \\\hline
E$_{HBEC}$ [eV] & 17.35 & 16.47 & 16.36\\
E$_{HOMO}$ (vs E$_{F}$) & 4.28 & 3.27 & 3.24\\
WF [eV] & 3.87 & 4.28 & 4.86\\\hline
	\label{tab:ups}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

It is important to consider that UPS is a surface sensitive measurement, the penetration depth of the ultraviolet range electrons are around 2 nm, which is significantly lower than our polymer thickness (around 70 nm). So this technique limits our understanding of the dopants diffusion through the whole volume of the polymer. Although, we had some insights of this topic from the previous section, further analysis could be done with X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy that has a higher penetration depth (around 5 nm), also limited. %but along with depth profiling mode

%The Ag/AgCl gate electrode’s work function is reasonably constant, the work function of an OMIEC gate electrode however may vary depending on its processing history and redox reactions with other species present in the electrolyte (e.g. molecular oxygen).28 Applying VGS only determines the potential difference between the gate and channel but does not control the potentials of either electrode (hence the position of the Fermi level) with respect to a reference. This leads to many challenges in operating an OECT with OMIEC gate electrodes.

%Achieving effective charge transfer between the analyte and OMIEC requires appropriate alignment of the electrochemical potential of electrons on the OMIEC electrode and the redox specie. Failure to do so may result in the subsequent transfer of charges to other redox-active sinks in the environment, leading to undesirable side reactions and products that may interfere with the OMIEC’s operation. Electrons flow from a region of higher to lower electrochemical potential. Hence, achieving electron transfer from redox-active species to the OMIEC requires the latter to have a deep LUMO (high electron affinity) \cite{tanMixedIonicElectronic2022} %paper
