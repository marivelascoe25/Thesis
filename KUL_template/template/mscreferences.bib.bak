  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Written from the perspective of an experimental chemist, this book puts together some fundamentals from chemistry, solid state physics and quantum chemistry, to help with understanding and predicting the electronic and optical properties of organic semiconductors, both polymers and small molecules. The text is intended to assist graduate students and researchers in the field of organic electronics to use theory to design more efficient materials for organic electronic devices, such as organic solar cells, light emitting diodes and field effect transistors. After addressing some basic topics in solid state physics, a comprehensive introduction to molecular orbitals and band theory leads to a description of computational methods based on Hartree-Fock and density functional theory (DFT), for predicting geometry conformations, frontier levels and energy band structures. Topological defects and transport and optical properties are then addressed, and one of the most commonly used transparent conducting polymers, PEDOT:PSS, is described in some detail as a case study.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Likewise, similar transport phenomena in organic semiconductors and ionics have led to new innovations in a wide variety of applications from energy generation and storage to displays and bioelectronics. Here, the underlying principles of conduction on the macroscale in biomolecular materials are discussed, highlighting recent examples, and particularly the establishment of accurate structure\textendash property relationships to guide rationale material and device design.

  month = dec,
  abstract = {The operation of various organic electrochemical devices relies on the intrinsic mixed conducting properties of {$\pi$}-conjugated polymers. One key factor that generally limits device performance is the slow transport of ions throughout the semiconducting polymer, necessary for bulk doping and dedoping. Thus, there has been increasing efforts to enhance the ionic conductivity of various conjugated polymers by chemically engineering the polarity of the side chains of the material. Such substituents however can impact the structure of these materials and render their electronic properties sensitive to environmental conditions. This work demonstrates the viability of multicomponent polymer blending as an alternative approach to tune mixed conductivity. A hydrophilic block copolymer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and poly(ethylene oxide) (P3HT-b-PEO) is blended with a mixed conducting random copolymer of P3HT and poly(3-hydroxyhexylthiophene) (P3HT-co-P3HHT). Electrochemical transistors of the blends exhibit similar transduction performance at steady state relative to those of the neat P3HT-co-P3HHT, however the response time is greatly reduced. We attribute this to faster electrochemical doping related to ion uptake due to the increased material hydrophilicity upon adding the block copolymer. Meanwhile, the P3HTmoiety of the block copolymer seems to act as a compatibilizer that can support the structural stability of the blend, which can subsequently support the operational stability of resulting devices. Thus, our work implies that engineering block copolymers to fabricate compatible blends is a promising method to enhance the performance and stability of mixed conducting materials.},

While the electrical characteristics of OECTs are analogous to those of conventional organic field effect transistors, appropriate models for OECTs have not yet been developed. In particular, little is known about the transient characteristics of OECTs, which are determined by a complex interplay between ionic and electronic motion. In this paper a simple model is presented that reproduces the steady-state and transient response of OECTs by considering these devices in terms of an ionic and an electronic circuit. A simple analytical expression is derived that can be used to fit steady-state OECT characteristics. For the transient regime, comparison with experimental data allowed an estimation of the hole mobility in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate). This work paves the way for rational optimization of OECTs.},

  abstract = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent a class of electronic devices that received increasing attention in recent years. Their unique working mechanism, which is defined by the interplay of electronic and ionic charge carriers, gives them in inherent similarity to biological synapses and thus renders the devices highly appealing for neuromorphic computing. While OECTs reported in literature are mostly employing aqueous electrolytes, this work focuses on newly developed systems with solid-state electrolytes, which are based on an ionic liquid and that should greatly facilitate applications. This thesis presents very promising electrical characteristics for these novel devices in terms of low threshold voltages ({$<$} 0.3V), high on/off-ratios ({$\sim$} 105), and maximum transconductance around 0V. Transfer curves were also found to exhibit remarkably large hysteresis, which is typically a drawback of transistor devices. However, here it represents an attractive feature for the particular applications sought. On the downside though, the devices also feature channel degradation and irreproducibility under ambient conditions. A new quantification method for hysteresis is introduced that allows to compare its relative extent through a parameter {$\psi$}, which also denotes the progress direction through its sign. Interface experiments indicate that the commonly recognised understanding of OECTs cannot be directly transferred to systems with solid-state electrolytes, of which the electrical characteristics could be rendered reproducible under inert conditions. This prerequisite allowed to identify hysteresis as a constant and reliable property of transfer characteristics, which appears to saturate above a certain gate bias and may potentially be based on coexisting equilibrium states. The suspicion that different mechanisms than originally assumed are involved was further substantiated by experiments with modified channels and exchanged electrolytes. These studies revealed that not only is the ionic liquid not decisive for the gating process, but moreover that external ion sources in general are not required for operating the OECT. It is suspected that the underlying mechanisms are based on inherently included sodium ions in the channel material PEDOT:PSS, which were proven to be approximately a hundred times higher concentrated as specified by the supplier ({$>$} 7000 ppm found). This insight allowed to interpret the outcome of investigations on the potential drop in PEDOT:PSS under various electrolytes. The comparison of devices with altered channel thicknesses revealed that different response times account for different extents of hysteresis, which was confirmed by its decrease for slower scan rates. However, it was also found that the hysteresis cannot be completely suppressed, which is considered a strong indicator of a bistable equilibrium state based on other than purely kinetic processes.},

  abstract = {A new class of dopant materials for organic hole transport layers, developed by the TU-Dresden spin-off project Credoxys, is investigated in this thesis. These dopants show an advantage regarding the absorption in the visible and near infrared range. Here, no parasitic absorption by dopant radical anions is detected. The focus is to study the doping efficiency and absorption of thin films doped with these materials. The mainly utilized host material was MeO-TPD, which is a common hole transport material. F6-TCNNQ serves as reference dopant, since it is an efficient dopant. Both materials are well-characterized in several scientific studies. As representative of the new materials, a prototype dopant (CDX-A) and a further developed dopant (CDX-B), are investigated. It is shown that both dopants are capable of doping MeO-TPD. Thereby, conductivity values of up to 2.25 {$\cdot$} 10-4 S/cm are achieved for MeO-TPD:CDX-B at a dopant concentration of 8 mol\%, while MeO-TPD:F6-TCNNQ exhibits only 1.66 {$\cdot$} 10-4 S/cm. By using impedance spectroscopy, doping efficiencies of 0.17 and 0.66 are determined for CDX-A and CDX-B in MeO-TPD at a dopant concentration of 1.7 mol\%. Thus, CDX-B yields a slightly worse result than F6-TCNNQ, which has a doping efficiency of 0.79 at the same dopant concentration. Because of additional trap states in the layers doped by CDX-A, which is detected with impedance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy is performed. The aim is to clarify whether the ligands of CDX-A are separated during the doping process, which could be the origin of the additional trap states. However, it is not possible to confirm this theory, since the spectrum of the ligands is largely consistent with that of CDX-A. Finally, also ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy of MeO-TPD doped by CDX-A is made. A shift in the chemical potential is confirmed.},

  abstract = {Organic mixed conductors are increasingly employed in electrochemical devices operating in aqueous solutions that leverage simultaneous transport of ions and electrons. Indeed, their mode of operation relies on changing their doping (oxidation) state by the migration of ions to compensate for electronic charges. Nevertheless, the structural and morphological changes that organic mixed conductors experience when ions and water penetrate the material are not fully understood. Through a combination of electrochemical, gravimetric, and structural characterization, the effects of water and anions with a hydrophilic conjugated polymer are elucidated. Using a series of sodium-ion aqueous salts of varying anion size, hydration shells, and acidity, the links between the nature of the anion and the transport and structural properties of the polymer are systematically studied. Upon doping, ions intercalate in the crystallites, permanently modifying the lattice spacings, and residual water swells the film. The polymer, however, maintains electrochemical reversibility. The performance of electrochemical transistors reveals that doping with larger, less hydrated, anions increases their transconductance but decreases switching speed. This study highlights the complexity of electrolyte-mixed conductor interactions and advances materials design, emphasizing the coupled role of polymer and electrolyte (solvent and ion) in device performance.},

We find that the dopants reside in both the aggregate and amorphous regions of the polymer, not just in the amorphous regions, as previously assumed.

This is particularly important for bioelectronic devices, which are designed to operate in biological systems. While redox-active materials based on conducting and semiconducting polymers represent an exciting class of materials for bioelectronic devices, they are susceptible to electrochemical side-reactions with molecular oxygen during device operation. Here, electrochemical side reactions with molecular oxygen are shown to occur during organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) operation using high-performance, state-of-the-art OECT materials. Depending on the choice of the active material, such reactions yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive side-product, which may be harmful to the local biological environment and may also accelerate device degradation. A design strategy is reported for the development of redox-active organic semiconductors based on donor\textendash acceptor copolymers that prevents the formation of H2O2 during device operation. This study elucidates the previously overlooked side-reactions between redox-active conjugated polymers and molecular oxygen in electrochemical devices for bioelectronics, which is critical for the operation of electrolyte-gated devices in application-relevant environments.},

Here, we demonstrate the implementation of neuromorphic functions similar to biological memory, such as short- to long-term memory transition, in non-volatile organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Depending on the training of the OECT, the device displays either short- or long-term plasticity, therefore, exhibiting non von Neumann characteristics with merged processing and storing functionalities.

  abstract = {Conducting polymers have attracted tremendous attention because of their unique characteristics, such as metal-like conductivity, ionic conductivity, optical transparency, and mechanical flexibility. Texture and nanostructural engineering of conjugated conducting polymers provide an outstanding pathway to facilitate their adoption in a variety of technological applications, including energy storage and harvesting devices, flexible optoelectronic devices, and wearable electronic devices. Generally, obtaining high carrier mobility in the presence of high carrier density is challenging and requires precise control of the texture and nanostructure of conducting polymers to avoid the charge localization. Preferential semicrystalline orientation, {$\pi$}\textendash{$\pi$} stacking distances, crystallite size, intra- and interchain couplings, intra- and intercrystallite connections, and grain boundaries are the key parameters that influence the charge carrier mobility and needs to be controlled by the synthesis parameters. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent texture and nanostructural engineering development of conducting polymers. In addition, this work describes the fundamental of charge carrier transport mechanisms in conducting polymers; and the latest progress on the optoelectronic characteristics of flexible transparent conductive electrodes based on conducting polymers is reported.},

Their implementation in organic transistors has led to enhanced biosensing, neuromorphic function, and specialized circuits. While a narrow class of conducting polymers continues to excel in these new applications, materials design efforts have accelerated as researchers target new functionality, processability, and improved performance/stability. Materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) require both efficient electronic transport and facile ion injection in order to sustain high capacity. In this work, we show that the product of the electronic mobility and volumetric charge storage capacity (\textmu C*) is the materials/system figure of merit; we use this framework to benchmark and compare the steady-state OECT performance of ten previously reported materials. This product can be independently verified and decoupled to guide materials design and processing. OECTs can therefore be used as a tool for understanding and designing new organic mixed conductors.},

Here, we compare optical, electrical, and morphological properties of P3HT films doped with F4TCNQ, both from mixed solutions and using sequential solution processing with orthogonal solvents. We demonstrate that sequential doping occurs rapidly ({$<$}1 s), and that the film doping level can be precisely controlled by varying the concentration of the doping solution. Furthermore, the choice of sequential doping solvent controls whether dopant anions are included or excluded from polymer crystallites. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) reveals that sequential doping produces significantly more uniform films on the nanoscale than the mixed-solution method. In addition, we show that mixed-solution doping induces the formation of aggregates even at low doping levels, resulting in drastic changes to film morphology. Sequentially coated films show 3\textendash 15 times higher conductivities at a given doping level than solution-doped films, with sequentially doped films processed to exclude dopant anions from polymer crystallites showing the highest conductivities. We propose a mechanism for doping induced aggregation in which the shift of the polymer HOMO level upon aggregation couples ionization and solvation energies. To show that the methodology is widely applicable, we demonstrate that several different polymer:dopant systems can be prepared by sequential doping.},

A key to the success of these aspirations is the ability to controllably dope organic semiconductors with high spatial resolution. Here, recent progress in molecular doping of organic semiconductors is summarized, with an emphasis on solution-processed p-type doped polymeric semiconductors. Highlighted topics include how solution-processing techniques can control the distribution, diffusion, and density of dopants within the organic semiconductor, and, in turn, affect the electronic properties of the material. Research in these areas has recently intensified, thanks to advances in chemical synthesis, improved understanding of charged states in organic materials, and a focus on relating fabrication techniques to morphology. Significant disorder in these systems, along with complex interactions between doping and film morphology, is often responsible for charge trapping and low doping efficiency. However, the strong coupling between doping, solubility, and morphology can be harnessed to control crystallinity, create doping gradients, and pattern polymers. These breakthroughs suggest a role for molecular doping not only in device function but also in fabrication\textemdash applications beyond those directly analogous to inorganic doping.},

The majority of OECT devices are made using the polymer blend poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), in which PEDOT is intrinsically doped due to inclusion of PSS. Because of this intrinsic doping, PEDOT:PSS OECTs generally operate in depletion mode, which results in a higher power consumption and limits stability. Here, a straightforward method to de-dope PEDOT:PSS using commercially available amine-based molecular de-dopants to achieve stable enhancement-mode OECTs is presented. The enhancement-mode OECTs show mobilities near that of pristine PEDOT:PSS ({$\approx$}2 cm2 V-1 s-1) with stable operation over 1000 on/off cycles. The electron and proton exchange among PEDOT, PSS, and the molecular de-dopants are characterized to reveal the underlying chemical mechanism of the threshold voltage shift to negative voltages. Finally, the effect of the de-doping on the microstructure of the spin-cast PEDOT:PSS films is investigated.},

Each dopant molecule is commonly thought to give rise to only one polaron, leading to a maximum of one donor:acceptor charge-transfer complex and hence an ionization efficiency of 100\%. However, this theoretical limit is rarely achieved because of incomplete charge transfer and the presence of unreacted dopant. Here, we establish that common p-dopants can in fact accept two electrons per molecule from conjugated polymers with a low ionization energy. Each dopant molecule participates in two charge-transfer events, leading to the formation of dopant dianions and an ionization efficiency of up to 200\%. Furthermore, we show that the resulting integer charge-transfer complex can dissociate with an efficiency of up to 170\%. The concept of double doping introduced here may allow the dopant fraction required to optimize charge conduction to be halved.},

We observe the presence of polycrystalline and amorphous domains within the doped pentacene film grown under co-deposition conditions. The appearance of the amorphous phase is induced by the molecular dopants F4-TCNQ and F6-TCNNQ. A strong drop of crystallite size is obtained at a doping concentration of around 7 and 4wt.\%, respectively. The loss of the polycrystalline structure is correlated to a strong decrease of the charge carrier mobility in pentacene in horizontal and vertical film structures. We discuss typical scenarios of charge transport for polycrystalline and amorphous thin films in order to explain the observed loss of mobility originated by the doping induced structural phase transition. In this way an optimum doping concentration for highest conductivity with acceptable mobility is determined which can help to improve the performance of organic solar cells and organic high-frequency rectification diodes.},

  abstract = {The understanding and applications of organic semiconductors have shown remarkable progress in recent years. This material class has been developed from being a lab curiosity to the basis of first successful products as small organic LED (OLED) displays; other areas of application such as OLED lighting and organic photovoltaics are on the verge of broad commercialization. Organic semiconductors are superior to inorganic ones for low-cost and large-area optoelectronics due to their flexibility, easy deposition, and broad variety, making tailor-made materials possible. However, electrical doping of organic semiconductors, i.e. the controlled adjustment of Fermi level that has been extremely important to the success of inorganic semiconductors, is still in its infancy. This review will discuss recent work on both fundamental principles and applications of doping, focused primarily to doping of evaporated organic layers with molecular dopants. Recently, both p- and n-type molecular dopants have been developed that lead to efficient and stable doping of organic thin films. Due to doping, the conductivity of the doped layers increases several orders of magnitude and allows for quasi-Ohmic contacts between organic layers and metal electrodes. Besides reducing voltage losses, doping thus also gives design freedom in terms of transport layer thickness and electrode choice. The use of doping in applications like OLEDs and organic solar cells is highlighted in this review. Overall, controlled molecular doping can be considered as key enabling technology for many different organic device types that can lead to significant improvements in efficiencies and lifetimes.},

  abstract = {Conjugated copolymers consisting of alternating donor and acceptor units play a prominent role in organic electronics, as their properties can be flexibly adapted to the respective field of application by chemical modifications and exchange of donors or acceptors. A prerequisite for understanding how these materials function is a deep knowledge of their structure-function relationships. This requires methods with a molecular resolution. TREPR spectroscopy in particular is suitable for investigating the electronic structure and morphology of these materials. In this work, DFT calculations were carried out in addition and necessary evaluation routines were developed. First, the electronic structure and morphology of the polymer PCDTBT and fragments of different lengths were investigated. Based on these results, the influence of additional hexyl  side chains was investigated in detail. For the dominant unit TBT, triplet formation pathways could be elucidated, in particular the direct excitation from the singlet ground state into the triplet state. Furthermore, by linking TBT with the already known acceptor NDI, the influence of two competing acceptors on the electronic structure was detected. Finally, two potential repeat units, NDI-T2 and T-NDI-T, were investigated for the polymer PNDIT2 and NDI-T2 was unequivocally identified as the dominant chromophore in the polymer.},

Herein, a series of ethylene glycol functionalized conjugated polymers is synthesized, and their electromechanical properties are evaluated through a combined approach of experimental measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. As demonstrated, alterations in the molecular structure of OMIECs impact numerous processes occurring during their electrochemical swelling, with sidechain length shortening decreasing the number of incorporated water molecules, reducing the generated void volumes and promoting the OMIECs to undergo different phase transitions. Ultimately, the impact of these combined molecular processes is assessed in organic electrochemical transistors, revealing that careful balancing of these phenomena is required to maximize device performance.},

The OECT operation relies on the mixed (ionic and electronic charge) conduction properties of the material in its channel. With the increased popularity of OECTs in bioelectronics applications and to benchmark mixed conduction properties of channel materials, the characterization methods have broadened somewhat heterogeneously. We intend this review to be a guide for the characterization methods of the OECT and the channel materials used. Our review is composed of two main sections. First, we review techniques to fabricate the OECT, introduce different form factors and configurations, and describe the device operation principle. We then discuss the OECT performance figures of merit and detail the experimental procedures to obtain these characteristics. In the second section, we shed light on the characterization of mixed transport properties of channel materials and describe how to assess films' interactions with aqueous electrolytes. In particular, we introduce experimental methods to monitor ion motion and diffusion, charge carrier mobility, and water uptake in the films. We also discuss a few theoretical models describing ion-polymer interactions. We hope that the guidelines we bring together in this review will help researchers perform a more comprehensive and consistent comparison of new materials and device designs, and they will be used to identify advances and opportunities to improve the device performance, progressing the field of organic bioelectronics.},

The interaction is thus determined by the ``local ionization potential'' of quaterthiophene.

Thus, the resulting material is ordered, exhibiting alternating layers of rigid semiconducting sheets and soft ion-conducting layers. This unique dual-network microstructure leads to a dynamic ionic/electronic nanocomposite with liquid-like ionic transport and highly mobile electronic charges.

The growing technological interest in these biotransducers makes the fundamental understanding of ion-to-electron coupling extremely important for the design of new materials and devices. One crucial aspect in this process that has been so far disregarded is the water taken up by the film during device operation and its effects on device performance. Here, using a series of the same electrolyte with varying ion concentrations, we quantify the amount of water that is incorporated into a hydrophilic p-type organic semiconductor film alongside the dopant anions and investigate structural and morphological changes occurring in the film upon electrochemical doping. We show that infiltration of the hydrated dopant ions into the film irreversibly changes the polymer structure and negatively impacts the efficiency, reversibility, and speed of charge generation. When less water is injected into the channel, OECTs exhibit higher transconductance and faster switching speeds. Although swelling is commonly suggested to be a necessity for efficient ion-to-electron transduction, this work uncovers the negative impact of a swollen channel material on the performance of accumulation mode OECTs and lays the foundation for future materials design.},

These bands are called valence and conduction band for inorganic semiconductors. For organic semiconductors the bands defining the band gap are often called highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). One advantage of semiconducting polymers is the ability to tune the band gap and the position of HOMO and LUMO levels by molecular chemical design. The organic photovoltaic solar cells need absorbers with a smaller bandgap to maximize the power conversion efficiency of these devices. There are several chemical strategies to synthesize low band gap polymers for optoelectronic applications. In this manuscript, an updated overview on the current status of these low band gap conjugated polymers will be given. The design principles of low band gap polymers, the properties of the resulting materials, and important applications and devices realized with this material class will be briefly discussed.},

Presented here is a molecular dynamics (MD) force field for modeling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X-ray diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a ``tilted stack'' and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a ``deflected stack'' and an s-bend side-chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals\textemdash through the {$\pi$}-stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways triethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a metastable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side-chain length dependence. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.},

This review looks at the major conducting polymer materials, namely, polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene and derivatives of polythiophene, as well as composites of these materials with carbon nanotubes and inorganic battery materials. Various treatments of the conducting polymer materials to improve their properties are considered and comparisons are made with other supercapacitor materials such as carbon and with inorganic battery materials. Conducting polymers are pseudo-capacitive materials, which means that the bulk of the material undergoes a fast redox reaction to provide the capacitive response and they exhibit superior specific energies to the carbon-based supercapacitors (double-layer capacitors). In general conducting polymers are more conductive than the inorganic battery materials and consequently have greater power capability. On the downside, conducting polymers swell and contract substantially on charge and discharge, respectively. Consequently, cycle-life is poor compared with carbon-based supercapacitors which generally only charge via adsorption and desorption of ions (giving typically a few thousand cycles for conducting polymers compared with {$>$}500000 cycles for carbon-based devices).},

The IGT has high transconductance, fast speed, and can be independently gated to create scalable conformable integrated circuits. We demonstrate the ability of the IGT to provide a miniaturized, comfortable interface with human skin using local amplification to record high-quality brain neurophysiological activity. The IGT is an effective transistor architecture for enabling integrated, real-time sensing and stimulation of signals from living organisms.},

OECT performance in aqueous electrolytes as well as the OMIECs' redox activity has spurred a myriad of studies employing OECTs as chemical transducers. However, the OECT's large (potentiometrically derived) transconductance is not fully leveraged in common approaches that directly conduct chemical reactions amperometrically within the OECT electrolyte with direct charge transfer between the analyte and the OMIEC, which results in sub-unity transduction of gate to drain current. Hence, amperometric OECTs do not truly display current gains in the traditional sense, falling short of the expected transistor performance. This study demonstrates an alternative device architecture that separates chemical transduction and amplification processes on two different electrochemical cells. This approach fully utilizes the OECT's large transconductance to achieve current gains of 103 and current modulations of four orders of magnitude. This transduction mechanism represents a general approach enabling high-gain chemical OECT transducers.},

Most importantly, the ability to access charge states with deep modulation through a large extent of its density of states and physical volume of the material enables OMIEC-based devices to display exciting new characteristics and opens up new degrees of freedom in device design. Leveraging the infinite possibilities of the organic synthetic toolbox, this perspective highlights several chemical and structural design approaches to modify OMIECs' properties important in device applications such as electronic and ionic conductivity, color, modulus, etc. Additionally, the ability for OMIECs to respond to external stimuli and transduce signals to myriad types of outputs has accelerated their development in smart systems. This perspective further illustrates how various stimuli such as electrical, chemical, and optical inputs fundamentally change OMIECs' properties dynamically and how these changes can be utilized in device applications.},

Recent efforts have combined the chemical detection with the transistor function of OECTs to achieve compact electrochemical sensors. However, these sensors often fall short of the expected amplification performance of OECTs. Here, we investigate the operation mechanism of various OECT architectures to deduce the design principles required to achieve reliable chemical detection and signal amplification. By utilizing a non-polarizable gate electrode and conducting the chemical reaction in a compartment separate from the OECT, the recently developed Reaction Cell OECT achieves reliable modulation of the OECT channel's charge density. This work demonstrates that systematic and rational design of OECT chemical sensors requires understanding the electrochemical processes that result in changes in the potential (charge density) of the channel, the underlying phenomenon behind amplification.},

One class of materials that show promise are Organic Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors (OMIECs), commonly semiconducting polymers, which are redoxactive and can simultaneously conduct ions and electrons. Electronic charges accumulated on the conjugated polymer backbone result in secondary property changes in electrochemical potential and electronic conductivity, allowing OMIECs to be implemented in a variety of devices such as chemical sensors, organic electrochemical transistors, and energy storage electrodes. Additionally, the mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility of these polymers enable conformable and seamless integration with biological interfaces, enabling bio-interfacing devices for continuous health monitoring. My PhD research investigates how OMIECs can be designed, characterized, and implemented in 1) polymer-based batteries for energy storage, 2) electrochemical sensors for the detection of biological analytes, 3) organic electrochemical transistors that amplify biosensing signals, and 4) tunable antennas for wireless signal transmission in microwave frequencies compatible with consumer electronics.

Tuning the OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low-powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics, such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, simple solution-processing methods are utilized to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of the OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air-sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, OECTs that are simultaneously low-powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions under ambient conditions are demonstrated. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which is once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.},

Varying the doping concentration, photoemission spectroscopy measurements show a comparable Fermi level shift for both dopants. The doping efficiency, defined as the ratio of free charge carriers (holes) to acceptors, is estimated from the depletion layer thickness in metal/intrinsic/p-doped structures. For low concentrations, we observe rather high doping efficiencies of up to 36\% for C60F36, whereas for both dopants the doping efficiency strongly decreases with increasing doping concentration down to less than 10\%. By numerically solving the charge neutrality equation using a classical semiconductor physics approach and comparing the results to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy data, we show that for very low concentrations doping is hindered by deep intragap states. In particular, the calculations can statistically explain the strong decrease of the doping efficiency for high doping concentrations.},

  abstract = {Electronic structure and optical absorption spectra of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) for different oxidation levels were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT. It is shown, that the DFT-based predictions for the polaronic and bipolaronic states and the nature of corresponding optical transitions are qualitatively different from the widely used traditional picture based on semi-empirical pre-DFT approaches that still dominate the current literature. On the basis of the results of our calculations, the experimental Vis/NIR absorbance spectroscopy and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy are re-examined, and a new interpretation of the measured spectra and the spin signal, which is qualitatively different from the traditional interpretation, is provided. The findings and conclusions concerning the nature of polaronic and bipolaronic states, band structure and absorption spectra presented for PEDOT, are generic for a wide class of conducting polymers (such as polythiophenes and their derivatives) that have a similar structure of monomer units.},

  abstract = {In this work, we focus on the formation of different kinds of charge carriers such as polarons and bipolarons upon p-type doping (oxidation) of the organic semiconductor poly(3- hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT). We elucidate the cyclic voltammogram during oxidation of this polymer and present spectroscopic changes upon doping in the UV/Vis/near-IR range as well as in the mid-IR range. In the low-oxidation regime, two absorption bands related to sub-gap transitions appear, one in the UV/Vis range and another one in the mid-IR range. The UV/Vis absorption gradually decreases upon further doping while the mid-IR absorption shifts to lower energy. Additionally, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements are performed, showing an increase of the EPR signal up to a certain doping level, which significantly decreases upon further doping. Furthermore, the absorption spectra in the UV/Vis range are analyzed in relation to the morphology (crystalline vs. amorphous) by using theoretical models. Finally, the calculated charge carriers from cyclic voltammogram are linked together with optical transitions as well as with the EPR signals upon p-type doping. We stress that our results indicate the formation of polarons at low doping levels and the existence of bipolarons at high doping levels. The presented spectroscopic data are an experimental evidence of the formation of bipolarons in P3HT.},

  abstract = {Despite their increasing usefulness in a wide variety of applications, organic electrochemical transistors still lack a comprehensive and unifying physical framework able to describe the current-voltage characteristics and the polymer/electrolyte interactions simultaneously. Building upon thermodynamic axioms, we present a quantitative analysis of the operation of organic electrochemical transistors. We reveal that the entropy of mixing is the main driving force behind the redox mechanism that rules the transfer properties of such devices in electrolytic environments. In the light of these findings, we show that traditional models used for organic electrochemical transistors, based on the theory of field-effect transistors, fall short as they treat the active material as a simple capacitor while ignoring the material properties and energetic interactions. Finally, by analyzing a large spectrum of solvents and device regimes, we quantify the entropic and enthalpic contributions and put forward an approach for targeted material design and device applications.},
