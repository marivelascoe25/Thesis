	title = {Organic electrochemical transistors with solid-state electrolytes},
	abstract = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent a class of electronic devices that received increasing attention in recent years. Their unique working mechanism, which is defined by the interplay of electronic and ionic charge carriers, gives them in inherent similarity to biological synapses and thus renders the devices highly appealing for neuromorphic computing. While OECTs reported in literature are mostly employing aqueous electrolytes, this work focuses on newly developed systems with solid-state electrolytes, which are based on an ionic liquid and that should greatly facilitate applications.
This thesis presents very promising electrical characteristics for these novel devices in terms of low threshold voltages ({\textless} 0.3V), high on/off-ratios (∼ 105), and maximum transconductance around 0V. Transfer curves were also found to exhibit remarkably large hysteresis, which is
typically a drawback of transistor devices. However, here it represents an attractive feature for the particular applications sought. On the downside though, the devices also feature channel degradation and irreproducibility under ambient conditions. A new quantification method for hysteresis is introduced that allows to compare its relative extent through a parameter ψ, which also denotes the progress direction through its sign. Interface experiments indicate that the commonly recognised understanding of OECTs cannot be directly transferred to systems with solid-state electrolytes, of which the electrical characteristics could be rendered reproducible under inert conditions. This prerequisite allowed to identify hysteresis as a constant and reliable property of transfer characteristics, which appears to saturate above a certain gate bias and may potentially be based on coexisting equilibrium states. The suspicion that different mechanisms
than originally assumed are involved was further substantiated by experiments with modified channels and exchanged electrolytes. These studies revealed that not only is the ionic liquid not decisive for the gating process, but moreover that external ion sources in general are not required for operating the OECT. It is suspected that the underlying mechanisms are based on inherently included sodium ions in the channel material PEDOT:PSS, which were proven to be
approximately a hundred times higher concentrated as specified by the supplier ({\textgreater} 7000 ppm found). This insight allowed to interpret the outcome of investigations on the potential drop in PEDOT:PSS under various electrolytes. The comparison of devices with altered channel
thicknesses revealed that different response times account for different extents of hysteresis, which was confirmed by its decrease for slower scan rates. However, it was also found that the hysteresis cannot be completely suppressed, which is considered a strong indicator of a bistable equilibrium state based on other than purely kinetic processes.},

	title = {Doping {Properties} of {Novel} {Dopants} for {Organic} {Hole} {Transport} {Layers}},
	abstract = {A new class of dopant materials for organic hole transport layers, developed by the TU-Dresden spin-off project Credoxys, is investigated in this thesis. These dopants show an advantage regarding the absorption in the visible and near infrared range.
Here, no parasitic absorption by dopant radical anions is detected. The focus is to study the doping efficiency and absorption of thin films doped with these materials.
The mainly utilized host material was MeO-TPD, which is a common hole transport material. F6-TCNNQ serves as reference dopant, since it is an efficient dopant. Both materials are well-characterized in several scientific studies. As representative of the new materials, a prototype dopant (CDX-A) and a further developed dopant (CDX-B), are investigated. It is shown that both dopants are capable of doping MeO-TPD. Thereby, conductivity values of up to 2.25 · 10−4 S/cm
are achieved for MeO-TPD:CDX-B at a dopant concentration of 8 mol\%, while MeO-TPD:F6-TCNNQ exhibits only 1.66 · 10−4 S/cm.
By using impedance spectroscopy, doping efficiencies of 0.17 and 0.66 are determined for CDX-A and CDX-B in MeO-TPD at a dopant concentration of 1.7 mol\%. Thus, CDX-B yields a slightly worse result than F6-TCNNQ, which has a doping efficiency of 0.79 at the same dopant concentration. Because of additional trap states in the layers doped by CDX-A, which is detected with impedance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy is performed. The aim is to clarify whether the ligands of CDX-A are separated during the doping process,
which could be the origin of the additional trap states. However, it is not possible to confirm this theory, since the spectrum of the ligands is largely consistent with that of CDX-A.
Finally, also ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy of MeO-TPD doped by CDX-A is made. A shift in the chemical potential is confirmed.},

	abstract = {The organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is one of the most versatile devices within the bioelectronics toolbox, with its compatibility with aqueous media and the ability to transduce and amplify ionic and biological signals into an electronic output. The OECT operation relies on the mixed (ionic and electronic charge) conduction properties of the material in its channel. With the increased popularity of OECTs in bioelectronics applications and to benchmark mixed conduction properties of channel materials, the characterization methods have broadened somewhat heterogeneously. We intend this review to be a guide for the characterization methods of the OECT and the channel materials used. Our review is composed of two main sections. First, we review techniques to fabricate the OECT, introduce different form factors and configurations, and describe the device operation principle. We then discuss the OECT performance figures of merit and detail the experimental procedures to obtain these characteristics. In the second section, we shed light on the characterization of mixed transport properties of channel materials and describe how to assess films' interactions with aqueous electrolytes. In particular, we introduce experimental methods to monitor ion motion and diffusion, charge carrier mobility, and water uptake in the films. We also discuss a few theoretical models describing ion-polymer interactions. We hope that the guidelines we bring together in this review will help researchers perform a more comprehensive and consistent comparison of new materials and device designs, and they will be used to identify advances and opportunities to improve the device performance, progressing the field of organic bioelectronics.},

Each dopant molecule is commonly thought to give rise to only one polaron, leading to a maximum of one donor:acceptor charge-transfer complex and hence an ionization efficiency of 100\%. However, this theoretical limit is rarely achieved because of incomplete charge transfer and the presence of unreacted dopant. Here, we establish that common p-dopants can in fact accept two electrons per molecule from conjugated polymers with a low ionization energy. Each dopant molecule participates in two charge-transfer events, leading to the formation of dopant dianions and an ionization efficiency of up to 200\%. Furthermore, we show that the resulting integer charge-transfer complex can dissociate with an efficiency of up to 170\%. The concept of double doping introduced here may allow the dopant fraction required to optimize charge conduction to be halved.},

	abstract = {Tailoring organic semiconductors to facilitate mixed conduction of ionic and electronic charges when interfaced with an aqueous media has spurred many recent advances in organic bioelectronics. The field is still restricted, however, by very few n-type (electron-transporting) organic semiconductors with adequate performance metrics. Here, a new electron-deficient, fused polycyclic aromatic system, TNR, is reported with excellent n-type mixed conduction properties including a µC* figure-of-merit value exceeding 30 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for the best performing derivative. Comprising three naphthalene bis-isatin moieties, this new molecular design builds on successful small-molecule mixed conductors; by extending the molecular scaffold into the oligomer domain, good film-forming properties, strong π–π interactions, and consequently excellent charge-transport properties are obtained. Through judicious optimization of the side chains, the linear oligoether and branched alkyl chain derivative bgTNR is obtained which shows superior mixed conduction in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration including an electron mobility around 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1. By optimizing the side chains, the dominant molecular packing can be changed from a preferential edge-on orientation (with high charge-transport anisotropy) to an oblique orientation that can support 3D transport pathways which in turn ensure highly efficient mixed conduction properties across the bulk semiconductor film.},

Here we demonstrate an organic nanocomposite that spontaneously forms when mixing an organic semiconductor with an ionic liquid and exhibits efficient room-temperature mixed conduction. We use a polymer known to form a semicrystalline microstructure to template ion intercalation into the side-chain domains of the crystallites, which leaves electronic transport pathways intact. Thus, the resulting material is ordered, exhibiting alternating layers of rigid semiconducting sheets and soft ion-conducting layers. This unique dual-network microstructure leads to a dynamic ionic/electronic nanocomposite with liquid-like ionic transport and highly mobile electronic charges. Using a combination of operando X-ray scattering and in situ spectroscopy, we confirm the ordered structure of the nanocomposite and uncover the mechanisms that give rise to efficient electron transport. These results provide fundamental insights into charge transport in organic semiconductors, as well as suggesting a pathway towards future improvements in these nanocomposites.},

Herein, three fluorinated alcohols (FAs), including 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), and perfluoro-tert-butanol (PFTB), were employed as the alternative solvents for engineering the n-type small-molecule active layer gNR. Remarkedly, an impressive μC* of 5.12 F V–1 cm–1 s–1 and a normalized transconductance of 1.216 S cm–1 are achieved from the HFIP-fabricated gNR OECTs, which is three times higher than that of chloroform. The operational stability has been significantly enhanced by the FA-fabricated devices. Such enhancements can be ascribed to the aggregation-induced structural ordering by FAs during spin coating, which optimizes the microstructure of the films for a better mixed ion and electron transport. These results prove the huge research potential of FAs to improve OECT materials’ processability, device performance, and stability, therefore promoting practical bio-applications.},

	abstract = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) composed of organic mixed conductors can operate in aqueous, biological media and translate low-magnitude ionic fluctuations of biological origin into measurable electrical signals. The growing technological interest in these biotransducers makes the fundamental understanding of ion-to-electron coupling extremely important for the design of new materials and devices. One crucial aspect in this process that has been so far disregarded is the water taken up by the film during device operation and its effects on device performance. Here, using a series of the same electrolyte with varying ion concentrations, we quantify the amount of water that is incorporated into a hydrophilic p-type organic semiconductor film alongside the dopant anions and investigate structural and morphological changes occurring in the film upon electrochemical doping. We show that infiltration of the hydrated dopant ions into the film irreversibly changes the polymer structure and negatively impacts the efficiency, reversibility, and speed of charge generation. When less water is injected into the channel, OECTs exhibit higher transconductance and faster switching speeds. Although swelling is commonly suggested to be a necessity for efficient ion-to-electron transduction, this work uncovers the negative impact of a swollen channel material on the performance of accumulation mode OECTs and lays the foundation for future materials design.},

Organic field-effect transistors have the potential to be the basic device for flexible electronics, but still need much improvement. In particular, despite more than 20 years of research, organic inversion mode transistors have not been reported so far. Here we discuss the first realization of organic inversion transistors and the optimization of organic depletion transistors by our organic doping technology. We show that the transistor parameters—in particular, the threshold voltage and the ON/OFF ratio—can be controlled by the doping concentration and the thickness of the transistor channel. Injection of minority carriers into the doped transistor channel is achieved by doped contacts, which allows forming an inversion layer.},

Although several air-stable and highly efficient n-dopants have been developed, the reason for the varying air sensitivity between different n-doped layers, in which the n-dopant molecules are dispersed, is not fully understood. In contrast to previous studies that compared the air stability of doped films with the energy levels of neat host or dopant layers, we trace back the varying degree of air sensitivity to the energy levels of integer charge transfer states (ICTCs) formed by host anions and dopant cations. Our data indicate a universal limit for the ionization energy of ICTCs above which the n-doped semiconductors are air-stable.},

This enables analyzing the OECTs electrical performance as well as a simplified chemical properties via an electrical double layer, doping and de-doping of the OMIEC layer.

Since in Si technologies such traps can lead to severe reliability issues, we perform a combined study of both the hysteresis as well as the arguably most important reliability issue, the bias-temperature instability. We use single-layer MoS2 FETs with SiO2 and hBN insulators and demonstrate that both phenomena are indeed due to traps in the gate insulator with time constants distributed over wide timescales, where the faster ones lead to hysteresis and the slower ones to bias-temperature instabilities. Our data show that the use of hBN as a gate insulator considerably reduces the number of accessible slow traps and thus improves the reliability. However, the reliability of hBN insulators deteriorates with increasing temperature due to the thermally activated nature of charge trapping.},

	abstract = {MoS2 has received a lot of attention lately as a semiconducting channel material for electronic devices, in part due to its large band gap as compared to that of other 2D materials. Yet, the performance and reliability of these devices are still severely limited by defects which act as traps for charge carriers, causing severely reduced mobilities, hysteresis, and long-term drift. Despite their importance, these defects are only poorly understood. One fundamental problem in defect characterization is that due to the large defect concentration only the average response to bias changes can be measured. On the basis of such averaged data, a detailed analysis of their properties and identification of particular defect types are difficult. To overcome this limitation, we here characterize single defects on MoS2 devices by performing measurements on ultrascaled transistors (∼65 × 50 nm) which contain only a few defects. These single defects are characterized electrically at varying gate biases and temperatures. The measured currents contain random telegraph noise, which is due to the transfer of charge between the channel of the transistors and individual defects, visible only due to the large impact of a single elementary charge on the local electrostatics in these small devices. Using hidden Markov models for statistical analysis, we extract the charge capture and emission times of a number of defects. By comparing the bias-dependence of the measured capture and emission times to the prediction of theoretical models, we provide simple rules to distinguish oxide traps from adsorbates on these back-gated devices. In addition, we give simple expressions to estimate the vertical and energetic positions of the defects. Using the methods presented in this work, it is possible to locate the sources of performance and reliability limitations in 2D devices and to probe defect distributions in oxide materials with 2D channel materials.},

In this paper, we show that this problem can be overcome by using a “cold” metal as the injection source of a transistor; these metals are different from conventional metals and can filter out high-energy electrons to break the “Boltzmann tyranny.” It is proved that the subthreshold swing of the thermionic current of a transistor using a “cold”-metal contact can be much smaller than 60 mV/decade at room temperature. Specifically, the two-dimensional transition-metal-dichalcogenide (TMD) “cold” metals NbX2 and TaX2 (X=S,Se,Te) are proposed as injection sources for FETs. Quantum transport simulations indicate that a promising switching efficiency and on-state current can be achieved using TMD “cold”-metal injection sources, which is beneficial for energy efficiency.},

One of the key factors in this achievement is the use of a B2-type Ni-Al seed layer on the wafer as a (001)-oriented and an atomically smooth template. Another is the insertion of a thin Al layer prior to MgO sputtering as protection from plasma damage, resulting in the formation of a spinel-type single-crystal Mg-Al-O tunnel barrier after in situ annealing. This epitaxial technology for transition metals on large wafers will lead to advanced practical spintronics devices incorporating high-performance single-crystalline materials such as chemical-ordered alloys and tunnel barriers.},

	abstract = {When two-dimensional (2D) group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides such as tungsten disulfide (WS2) are grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for atomic growth control at low deposition temperatures (≤450 °C), they often suffer from a nanocrystalline grain structure limiting the carrier mobility. The crystallinity and monolayer thickness control during ALD of 2D materials is determined by the nucleation mechanism, which is currently not well understood. Here, we propose a qualitative model for the WS2 nucleation behavior on dielectric surfaces during plasma-enhanced (PE-) ALD using tungsten hexafluoride (WF6), dihydrogen (H2) plasma and dihydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on analyses of the morphology of the WS2 crystals. The WS2 crystal grain size increases from ∼20 to 200 nm by lowering the nucleation density. This is achieved by lowering the precursor adsorption rate on the starting surface using an inherently less reactive starting surface, by decreasing the H2 plasma reactivity, and by enhancing the mobility of the adsorbed species at higher deposition temperature. Since silicon dioxide (SiO2) is less reactive than aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and diffusion and crystal ripening is enhanced at higher deposition temperature, WS2 nucleates in an anisotropic island-like growth mode with preferential lateral growth from the WS2 crystal edges. This work emphasizes that increasing the crystal grain size while controlling the basal plane orientation is possible during ALD at low deposition temperatures, based on insight in the nucleation behavior, which is key to advance the field of ALD of 2D materials. Moreover, this work demonstrates the conformal deposition on three-dimensional (3D) structures, with WS2 retaining the basal plane orientation along topographic structures.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as WS2 are promising materials for nanoelectronic applications. However, growth of the desired horizontal basal-plane oriented 2D TMD layers is often accompanied by the growth of vertical nanostructures that can hinder charge transport and, consequently, hamper device application. In this work, we discuss both the formation and suppression of vertical nanostructures during plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) of WS2. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy studies, formation pathways of vertical nanostructures are established for a two-step (AB-type) PEALD process. Grain boundaries are identified as the principal formation centers of vertical nanostructures. Based on the obtained insights, we introduce an approach to suppress the growth of vertical nanostructures, wherein an additional step (C)—a chemically inert Ar plasma or a reactive H2 plasma—is added to the original two-step (AB-type) PEALD process. This approach reduces the vertical nanostructure density by 80\%. It was confirmed that suppression of vertical nanostructures goes hand in hand with grain size enhancement. The vertical nanostructure density reduction consequently lowers film resistivity by an order of magnitude. Insights obtained in this work can contribute toward devising additional pathways, besides plasma treatments, for suppressing the growth of vertical nanostructures and improving the material properties of 2D TMDs that are relevant for nanoelectronic device applications.},

	abstract = {2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are among the most exciting materials of today. Their layered crystal structures result in unique and useful electronic, optical, catalytic, and quantum properties. To realize the technological potential of TMDCs, methods depositing uniform films of controlled thickness at low temperatures in a highly controllable, scalable, and repeatable manner are needed. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a chemical gas-phase thin film deposition method capable of meeting these challenges. In this review, the applications evaluated for ALD TMDCs are systematically examined, including electronics and optoelectonics, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, energy storage, lubrication, plasmonics, solar cells, and photonics. This review focuses on understanding the interplay between ALD precursors and deposition conditions, the resulting film characteristics such as thickness, crystallinity, and morphology, and ultimately device performance. Through rational choice of precursors and conditions, ALD is observed to exhibit potential to meet the varying requirements of widely different applications. Beyond the current state of ALD TMDCs, the future prospects, opportunities, and challenges in different applications are discussed. The authors hope that the review aids in bringing together experts in the fields of ALD, TMDCs, and various applications to eventually realize industrial applications of ALD TMDCs.},

The as-fabricated n-type DS-FETs present a minimum SS as low as 37 mV dec−1 at room temperature and a high I60 of 2.6 µA µm−1 (Vds = 0.1 V), which reflect an advantage in the on-state performance of more than two orders of magnitude over the TFETs.

Quantitative analysis of CM spectra of doped P3HT show that dopants induce measurable changes in the P3HT local chain conformation. We find that the dopants reside in both the aggregate and amorphous regions of the polymer, not just in the amorphous regions, as previously assumed. With increased doping, the P3HT intrachain disorder grows, causing the P3HT chains to become more oligomer-like, which we postulate leads to the drop in mobility commonly observed in literature.},

A key to the success of these aspirations is the ability to controllably dope organic semiconductors with high spatial resolution. Here, recent progress in molecular doping of organic semiconductors is summarized, with an emphasis on solution-processed p-type doped polymeric semiconductors. Highlighted topics include how solution-processing techniques can control the distribution, diffusion, and density of dopants within the organic semiconductor, and, in turn, affect the electronic properties of the material. Research in these areas has recently intensified, thanks to advances in chemical synthesis, improved understanding of charged states in organic materials, and a focus on relating fabrication techniques to morphology. Significant disorder in these systems, along with complex interactions between doping and film morphology, is often responsible for charge trapping and low doping efficiency. However, the strong coupling between doping, solubility, and morphology can be harnessed to control crystallinity, create doping gradients, and pattern polymers. These breakthroughs suggest a role for molecular doping not only in device function but also in fabrication—applications beyond those directly analogous to inorganic doping.},

	abstract = {The development of wearable devices for continuous health monitoring of biomarkers requires materials that are mechanically compliant, biocompatible, and are sensitive to biochemical molecules. One class of materials that show promise are Organic Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductors (OMIECs), commonly semiconducting polymers, which are redoxactive and can simultaneously conduct ions and electrons. Electronic charges accumulated on the conjugated polymer backbone result in secondary property changes in electrochemical potential and electronic conductivity, allowing OMIECs to be implemented in a variety of devices such as chemical sensors, organic electrochemical transistors, and energy storage electrodes. Additionally, the mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility of these polymers enable conformable and seamless integration with biological interfaces, enabling bio-interfacing devices for continuous health monitoring. My PhD research investigates how OMIECs can be designed, characterized, and implemented in 1) polymer-based batteries for energy storage, 2) electrochemical sensors for the detection of biological analytes, 3) organic electrochemical transistors that amplify biosensing signals, and 4) tunable antennas for wireless signal transmission in microwave frequencies compatible with consumer electronics. Leveraging fundamental materials characterization to drive the understanding of device physics, these OMIEC-based technologies are integrated into a fully self-powered and wireless glucose sensor.},

TREPR spectroscopy in particular is suitable for investigating the electronic structure and morphology of these materials. In this work, DFT calculations were carried out in addition and necessary evaluation routines were developed. First, the electronic structure and morphology of the polymer PCDTBT and fragments of different lengths were investigated. Based on these results, the influence of additional hexyl 
side chains was investigated in detail. For the dominant unit TBT, triplet formation pathways could be elucidated, in particular the direct excitation from the singlet ground state into the triplet state. Furthermore, by linking TBT with the already known acceptor NDI, the influence of two competing acceptors on the electronic structure was detected. Finally, two potential repeat units, NDI-T2 and T-NDI-T, were investigated for the polymer PNDIT2 and NDI-T2 was unequivocally identified as the dominant chromophore in the polymer.},

Although significant advances have been made to maximize the dimensional changes that can be accomplished by OMIECs, there is currently limited understanding of how changes in their molecular structures impact their underpinning fundamental processes and their performance in electronic devices. Herein, a series of ethylene glycol functionalized conjugated polymers is synthesized, and their electromechanical properties are evaluated through a combined approach of experimental measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. As demonstrated, alterations in the molecular structure of OMIECs impact numerous processes occurring during their electrochemical swelling, with sidechain length shortening decreasing the number of incorporated water molecules, reducing the generated void volumes and promoting the OMIECs to undergo different phase transitions. Ultimately, the impact of these combined molecular processes is assessed in organic electrochemical transistors, revealing that careful balancing of these phenomena is required to maximize device performance.},

	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-03537553/document},
	abstract = {The operation of various organic electrochemical devices relies on the intrinsic mixed conducting properties of π-conjugated polymers. One key factor that generally limits device performance is the slow transport of ions throughout the semiconducting polymer, necessary for bulk doping and dedoping. Thus, there has been increasing efforts to enhance the ionic conductivity of various conjugated polymers by chemically engineering the polarity of the side chains of the material. Such substituents however can impact the structure of these materials and render their electronic properties sensitive to environmental conditions. This work demonstrates the viability of multicomponent polymer blending as an alternative approach to tune mixed conductivity. A hydrophilic block copolymer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and poly(ethylene oxide) (P3HT-b-PEO) is blended with a mixed conducting random copolymer of P3HT and poly(3-hydroxyhexylthiophene) (P3HT-co-P3HHT). Electrochemical transistors of the blends exhibit similar transduction performance at steady state relative to those of the neat P3HT-co-P3HHT, however the response time is greatly reduced. We attribute this to faster electrochemical doping related to ion uptake due to the increased material hydrophilicity upon adding the block copolymer. Meanwhile, the P3HTmoiety of the block copolymer seems to act as a compatibilizer that can support the structural stability of the blend, which can subsequently support the operational stability of resulting devices. Thus, our work implies that engineering block copolymers to fabricate compatible blends is a promising method to enhance the performance and stability of mixed conducting materials.},

OECT performance in aqueous electrolytes as well as the OMIECs’ redox activity has spurred a myriad of studies employing OECTs as chemical transducers. However, the OECT's large (potentiometrically derived) transconductance is not fully leveraged in common approaches that directly conduct chemical reactions amperometrically within the OECT electrolyte with direct charge transfer between the analyte and the OMIEC, which results in sub-unity transduction of gate to drain current. Hence, amperometric OECTs do not truly display current gains in the traditional sense, falling short of the expected transistor performance. This study demonstrates an alternative device architecture that separates chemical transduction and amplification processes on two different electrochemical cells. This approach fully utilizes the OECT's large transconductance to achieve current gains of 103 and current modulations of four orders of magnitude. This transduction mechanism represents a general approach enabling high-gain chemical OECT transducers.},

Their multifunctional properties arise from their ability to simultaneously participate in redox reactions as well as modulation of ionic and electronic charge density throughout the bulk of the material. Most importantly, the ability to access charge states with deep modulation through a large extent of its density of states and physical volume of the material enables OMIEC-based devices to display exciting new characteristics and opens up new degrees of freedom in device design. Leveraging the infinite possibilities of the organic synthetic toolbox, this perspective highlights several chemical and structural design approaches to modify OMIECs’ properties important in device applications such as electronic and ionic conductivity, color, modulus, etc. Additionally, the ability for OMIECs to respond to external stimuli and transduce signals to myriad types of outputs has accelerated their development in smart systems.

Tuning the OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low-powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics, such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, simple solution-processing methods are utilized to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of the OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air-sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, OECTs that are simultaneously low-powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions under ambient conditions are demonstrated. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which is once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.},

The interaction is thus determined by the “local ionization potential” of quaterthiophene. Consequently, using materials parameters determined on a macroscopic length scale as a guideline for making new charge-transfer complex materials for high electrical conductivity turns out to be oversimplified, and a reliable material design must take into account property variations on the nm scale as well.},

	abstract = {The ability to control the charge density of organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (OMIECs) via reactions with redox-active analytes has enabled applications as electrochemical redox sensors. Their charge density-dependent conductivity can additionally be tuned via charge injection from electrodes, for instance in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), where volumetric charging of the OMIEC channel enables excellent transconductance and amplification of low potentials. Recent efforts have combined the chemical detection with the transistor function of OECTs to achieve compact electrochemical sensors. However, these sensors often fall short of the expected amplification performance of OECTs. Here, we investigate the operation mechanism of various OECT architectures to deduce the design principles required to achieve reliable chemical detection and signal amplification. By utilizing a non-polarizable gate electrode and conducting the chemical reaction in a compartment separate from the OECT, the recently developed Reaction Cell OECT achieves reliable modulation of the OECT channel's charge density. This work demonstrates that systematic and rational design of OECT chemical sensors requires understanding the electrochemical processes that result in changes in the potential (charge density) of the channel, the underlying phenomenon behind amplification.},

	abstract = {Abstract Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) show great promise for flexible, low-cost, and low-voltage sensors for aqueous solutions. The majority of OECT devices are made using the polymer blend poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), in which PEDOT is intrinsically doped due to inclusion of PSS. Because of this intrinsic doping, PEDOT:PSS OECTs generally operate in depletion mode, which results in a higher power consumption and limits stability. Here, a straightforward method to de-dope PEDOT:PSS using commercially available amine-based molecular de-dopants to achieve stable enhancement-mode OECTs is presented. The enhancement-mode OECTs show mobilities near that of pristine PEDOT:PSS (≈2 cm2 V−1 s−1) with stable operation over 1000 on/off cycles. The electron and proton exchange among PEDOT, PSS, and the molecular de-dopants are characterized to reveal the underlying chemical mechanism of the threshold voltage shift to negative voltages. Finally, the effect of the de-doping on the microstructure of the spin-cast PEDOT:PSS films is investigated.},
