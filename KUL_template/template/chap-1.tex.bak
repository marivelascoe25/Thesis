\section{Organic Semiconductors}

%When atoms bond together, molecular orbital are defined by the linear combination of atomic orbitals, however the symmetry shown on some complex structures are not explained by a simple linear combination, instead hybrid atomic orbitals are formed. This mathematical process is called \textbf{hybridization}.
Unlike inorganic semiconductors, organic semiconductors are lightweight, easy to chemically tune, mechanical flexible, and offer low-cost and low-temperature processing. All of these characteristics are responsible for the increased attention to this type of materials in the field of organic electronics. 

%\subsection{Conjugated polymers}
%\subsection{Small molecules}

\subsection{Electronic Structure and Transport} 

Organic semiconductors are $\pi$-conjugated molecules that comprise mostly carbon and hydrogen atoms, with alternating multiple (sp$^{2}$ hybridization) and single (sp hybridization) bonds. The wavefunction of the sp$^{2}$ orbitals overlap so that electrons can be delocalized.
%This configuration exhibit $p$-orbitals with delocalized electrons. %, charge transport among the length of these polymers is caused by the alternation of these bonds, describing a resonance structure. 
Based on the size of the conjugated system, organic semiconductors can be divided into conjugated polymers and small molecules. The latter has the advantage of being ordered and its synthesis allows to obtain high purity material \cite{alcacerElectronicStructureOrganic2018}.

  \label{fig:ediag}
\end{figure}

The energy structure of organic semiconductors comprises a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) state and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) state, which are analogous to the valence and conduction bands, respectively, from inorganic semiconductors. The difference between these energy levels corresponds to the energy gap (E$_{g}$) of the material, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ediag}. Additionally, we can define i) the Fermi level (E$_{F}$) using the material's work function (WF), ii) the ionization energy (IE), also referred as ionization potential (IP), using the HOMO energy, and iii) the electron affinity (EA), using the LUMO energy.

%\subsubsection{Conjugated polymers}
%Semiconducting properties of conjugated polymers built by alternating electron donor and acceptor moieties \cite{mattElectronicStructureMorphology2021}, 
%Since inorganic semiconductors' band models does not take into consideration the Coulomb and exchange electron-electron interaction, which play a major role in organic semiconductors, it is necessary to add new theoretical approaches. On one hand, the transport properties are better described in terms of a hopping mechanism and the optoelectronic properties are better described by the molecular orbital picture \cite{alcacerElectronicStructureOrganic2018}. Since the device under study in this work is a transistor and their transport properties in aqueous and quasi-solid environments, the theoretical approach used will be the hopping mechanism.

%Transport properties depend on the details of the band structure, namely the density of states and the band widths

%\subsubsection{Small Molecules}
%Unlike conjugated polymers, the chain size of small molecules have the advantage of being ordered and its synthesis allow to obtain high purity material.

%\subsection{Electronic Transport}

Organic semiconductor materials can also be classified based on whether their ground state is degenerate or non-degenerate. In the former case, the term ``degenerate'' describes monomers that have equivalent energy states in the ground state. In contrast, in the latter case, the ground state exhibits non-degeneracy, which is commonly observed due to the energy difference of aromatic (benzoid) and quinoid structures \cite{heegerSolitonsConductingPolymers1988a}, as exhibited in Figure \ref{fig:energy}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption[Degenerate and non-degenerate conjugated polymers]{Potential energy change (electronic plus lattice distortion energy) in A) degenerate and B) non-degenerate ground-state-conjugated polymers. Extracted from reference \cite{heydarigharahcheshmehTextureNanostructuralEngineering2020}.}
  \label{fig:energy}
\end{figure}

%Transport in an organic semiconductor creates changes in the bond-length alternation pattern. Since charge transport come together with a chain distortion, new quasiparticles are defined: solitons in degenerate molecules and polarons in non-degenerate molecules \cite{bredasRoleMobileOrganic1984}.
In electronic transport theory within organic semiconductors, the concept of polarons is introduced. This quasiparticle effectively captures the alteration of the bond-length alternation pattern induced by the movement of charge carriers (electrons or holes) \cite{bredasRoleMobileOrganic1984}. This alteration can be observed, for instance, when transitioning from Phase A to Phase B in degenerate molecules, or from aromatic to a quinoid structure in non-degenerate molecules.

 %Since charge transport come together with a chain distortion, new quasiparticles are defined in transport theory, in a degenerated molecule, the quasiparticles are named solitons, and in a non-degenerated molecule, a bound soliton-antisoliton is formed in the benzoid structures, the pair receive the name of polaron. This pair annihilate in the quinoid structure in between forming a double bond so neutral polarons are not stable \cite{bredasRoleMobileOrganic1984}.

\subsection{Molecular Doping} \label{subsec:moldop}
The basic principles of molecular doping are similar than in inorganic materials. A donor or acceptor entity is added to generate electrons or holes, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dopscheme}. While n-type dopants donate electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) states, the p-type dopants extract electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) states, thus creating holes \cite{lussemDopingOrganicSemiconductors2013}. In other words, the Fermi level E$_{F}$ of the polymer will shift towards the LUMO (or HOMO) level when there is n-type (or p-type) doping. This shift can be quantified using spectroscopy techniques such as Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) at room temperature (RT) \cite{tietzeFermiLevelShift2012}, although it may be somewhat limited by the penetration depth of the incoming electrons.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \label{fig:dopscheme}
\end{figure}

When doping occurs, %charged solitons come as outcome in a degenerated molecules. In a non-degenerated, our main focus in this work, 
the formation of a new quasiparticle named bipolaron occurs. For instance, if p-type dopants are introduced to a degenerate molecule (as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:bipol}), electrons are removed from double bonds. Focusing on a single event, this removal leaves one carbon positively charged, with an adjacent carbon atom possessing an unpaired electron. This unpaired electron moves along the polymer chain until it encounters another unpaired electron from a separate doping event. When they come together, they form a double bond, resulting in the creation of two charged polarons: a bipolaron \cite{bredasPolaronsBipolaronsSolitons1985}. %Although, a nice simplification, in a degenerated molecule is not realistic, but usually

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \label{fig:bipol}
\end{figure}

The energy levels generated upon the formation of polarons and bipolarons in non-degenerate molecules are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ebipol}. As the doping density increases, the amount of bipolaron states also increases. Their overlapping leads to the formation of bipolaron bands, and the energy difference between the two in-gap states i and i*, as shown from Figure \ref{fig:ebipol}B to D, decreases. %Fix this part % \cite{bredasRoleMobileOrganic1984}

  \label{fig:ebipol}
\end{figure}

In addition to these new electronic states, the doped polymer will also exhibit distinct optical transitions that could be revealed through UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. In this technique, absorption peaks indicate the presence of these optical transitions. However, these transitions may not be precisely quantified or clearly defined \cite{heydarigharahcheshmehTextureNanostructuralEngineering2020}.
%Zozoulenko et al. proposed a new DFT-based description of the polaronic and bipolaronic states 
%% This specifics introduces to our graph

The use of small molecules as dopants for organic materials is commonly reported. Some strong acceptor (or electron-deficient) molecules that are widely used include 2,3,5,6 tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F$_{4}$TCNQ) or 1,3,4,5,7,8 hexafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanonaphthoquinodimethane (F$_{6}$TCNNQ), both of which are also relevant to this work. The latter exhibits a higher electronic affinity (-5.3 eV) than F$_{4}$TCNQ (-5.2eV), indicating that it can abstract electrons more efficiently, specially from polymers with low ionization potential (IP < 5eV) \cite{kieferDoubleDopingConjugated2019}%, as it is the case of p(g3T2-T) acting as donor
.

Among the various methods of molecular doping for conjugated polymers, Jacobs et al. conducted a comparison between solution-mixed and solution-sequential doping of P3HT, a thiophene-based polymer, doped with F$_{4}$TCNQ. These doping methods are considered straightforward and easy, especially when compared to other techniques such as vapour-phase doping \cite{fontanaEvaporationVsSolution2019}. Their research showed that solution-mixed films tend to have considerably rougher surface than solution-sequential films, which can negatively impact their conductivity \cite{jacobsComparisonSolutionmixedSequentially2016}. The fact that solution-sequential doped films exhibit better homogeneity also makes them more compatible with microstructuring processes such as photolithography. However, this advantage comes at the expense of having less control over the doping levels when compared to solution-mixed films \cite{tanOrganicMixedIonic2022}.

\section{Organic Mixed Ionic/Electronic Conductors (OMIECs)} \label{sec:omiecs}

Organic Mixed Ionic/Electronic conductors are a class of organic semiconductors that allow the conduction of electrons (or holes) and ions. This feature sets them apart from other organic semiconductors. %Organic semiconductors 
Commonly designed with polar side chains, OMIECs have been identified as a promising class of materials for the field of bioelectronics
%These materials, also called organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs), can exchange ions with aqueous electrolytes when electronic charge carriers are injected, transported, and stored in the bulk of the material
\cite{giovannittiEnergeticControlRedoxActive2020}. Initially investigated for batteries and super-capacitors \cite{snookConductingpolymerbasedSupercapacitorDevices2011}
\cite{liangOrganicElectrodeMaterials2012}, where the primary objective was to induce charges in a semiconducting polymer, OMIECs have rapidly expanded their scope to include other applications, among them, our focus: OECTs.
%Electronic charges accumulated on the conjugated polymer backbone result in secondary property changes in electrochemical potential and electronic conductivity \cite{tanOrganicMixedIonic2022}.

\end{figure}

Paulsen et al. classified OMIECs into six different categories based on whether they \textit{``intrinsically contain ionic charge''} (I, III, V) or not (II, IV, VI), the latter group comprises materials that \textit{``contain polar moieties that can solvate ions''}. Another distinguishing factor among these categories is whether the conjugated system is composed of a single material (homogeneous, type V and VI) or a two-component, more complex systems or block co-polymer materials (heterogeneous, type I, II, III, IV)\cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}. A schematic representation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:omiectypes}. %For instance, the conjugated polymer p(g3T2-T), used in this work, falls into a type VI OMIEC.


\subsection{Processes in OMIECs}

\subsubsection{Ionic-electronic interactions}
The presence of electronic charge in OMIECs %s in
requires also the presence of excess ionic charge, so charge in the system remains in balance. In the case of types II, IV, and VI OMIECs, a phenomenon known as stabilizing electrochemical doping is achieved through the presence of mobile ions that act as free charges. Conversely, other types of OMIECs have these stabilizing charges chemically bound and fixed, making them inherently doped.

% Explanation of parts where ion-coupling (electrostatic or direct electron transfer cases) occurs, and a third case where it does not occur, not necessary here, or would it be? I think this is the main difference on what is happening in my material, compared to PEDOT:PSS. So not sure if add the graphs

The degree of coupling between electronic charges and excess ionic charges in OMIECs can be modulated by applying a bias when connected through an electrolyte \cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}. This fundamental principle forms the basis of OECTs, which will be discussed further in Section \ref{sec:OECTs}.

\subsubsection{Electronic transport}
%Electronic charge carrier density in undoped semiconductor organic species is logically low (no accessible hopping states), but in contact with an electrolyte, due to the ionic-electronic coupling as described in previous subsection, dopant ions would ... \cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}. 

Electronic charge transport mechanisms present in OMIECs include thermally-activated hopping and band-like transport, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:etrans}. These mechanisms are not different from those observed in other conjugated polymers. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\subfloat[\textbf{Thermally activated hopping}]{{\includegraphics[width=5cm]{Images/pdf/OMIECetransport1.pdf} }}

	and B) band-like transport, %of a relatively-delocalized electronic charge carrier"
	where the electronic charge carrier is relatively localized and delocalized, respectively. Extracted from reference \cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}.} 
	\label{fig:etrans}
\end{figure}

Thermally-activated hopping, as its name implies, is driven by thermal energy and is limited by the degree of structural disorder. In this mechanism, weakly-bonded electrons in delocalized $\pi$-orbital move along adjacent $\pi$-orbitals within the length of the conjugated polymer, or even between molecules where there is sufficient $\pi$-$\pi$ overlapping. This mechanism predominates when there is a low electronic charge carrier density and a low density of accessible hopping states, resulting in low mobility and electrical conductivity \cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}. 

In contrast, band-like transport, typically occurs in OMIECs with increasing doping levels. In this case, the activation energy of charge hopping decreases, and carrier mobility increases. This leads to diffuse band-like charge transport within the polymer-stacking \cite{wangHoppingTransportHall2012}.
%"at extreme doping levels, increased disorder drives carrier localization, which results in a plateau or even decrease in electronic charge carrier mobility"

%"Non-conjugated radical polymers also present a thermally activated mechanism of charge transfer between pendant radical sites, though with a significant dependence on the local self-diffusion of polymer chain to bring radical sites close enough for efficient charge transfer51. This manifests as a hopping transport of electronic carriers (Fig. 2a) that is assisted via segmental motion (described below; Fig. 2g). Also in this case disorder plays a role, producing local variations in the molecular orbital energy levels and spreading orbitals in a density of radical states52."


\subsubsection{Ionic transport}
While the transport of charged anions and cations in OMIECs share some similarities with the transport of electrons and holes, it is a more complex process, since ions can be \textit{``multi-valent, and form pairs and larger clusters; morever, they are sensitive to solvent and solvation''} \cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}.

Ion transport in dry OMIECs of type I, III, and V is unipolar because these ions are fixed on a polyelectrolyte. In contrast, in type II, IV, and VI OMIECs, both anions and cations are mobile. When OMIECs come into contact with an electrolyte, they tend to swell, allowing the penetration of excess ions from the electrolyte. Therefore, both mobile anions and cations contribute to ion transport to ensure electroneutrality. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

	\label{fig:itrans}
\end{figure}

There are two types of ionic charge transport in OMIECs: ion hopping and vehicular solvated-ion transport. In dry or minimally hydrated OMIECs, ion hopping assisted by segmental motion of the OMIEC side chains or backbone is the primary mechanism, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:itrans}A. However, when OMIECs are in contact with a solvent or liquid electrolyte, both mechanisms are present, with solvated ion vehicle transport being the predominant mode. For instance, in water-based electrolytes, proton diffusion occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism, where protons within water molecules diffuse through neighboring molecules. This involves a transfer of ionic effects through the hydrogen-bonded network, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:itrans}B.

Due to the existing ionic-electronic coupling, both ionic and electronic transport in OECTs and other OMIEC-electrolyte-based applications are not independent but are rather complex and must consider side effects such as hydration and electrolyte swelling \cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}, as will be further discuss in Section \ref{sec:OECTs}.

%\subsection{Electrochemical Doping}

%As mentioned before, when OMIEC are coupled with an electrolyte and additionally, it is biased with an external gate, ionic-electronic interactions can be modulated. The OMIEC can oxidize or reduce depending on the mobile ions that penetrate the film, ions induced charges allowing its doping.

%Along the morphologic changes of the OMIEC, due to with the generation of permanent distortion in the lattice spacing and expansion in the lamellar direction and contraction in in the $\pi$-$\pi$ direction" \cite{cendraRoleAnionTransport2019}
 
%"The electrochemical charging of OMIECs can be described as a capacitive faradaic charging process,
% there is current caused by charge transfer, other physical phenomenas such as desorption or adsorption can also lead to the aparition of current that is non faradaic reaction
%meaning that the OMIEC" is p-doped (oxidized, in the language of chemists) "through an electron transfer with the contact (current collector), while ions from the electrolyte penetrate inside the channel material to compensate the charge carriers on the polymer backbone electrostatically with no change in the inserted ion's oxidation state" \cite{giovannittiEnergeticControlRedoxActive2020}

%"Electrochemical doping produces a permanent distortion in the lattice spacings, inducing an expansion in the lamellar direction and a contraction in the $\pi$-$\pi$ direction" \cite{cendraRoleAnionTransport2019}

\section{Organic Electrochemical Transistors} \label{sec:OECTs}

Organic Electrochemical Transistors are composed of metallic source, drain and gate electrodes, an organic conjugated polymer channel (specifically an OMIEC as described in previous sections), and an electrolyte that bridges the channel and the gate, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:bernard}A. OECTs are devices that have received increasingly attention due to their mechanically compliance, biocompatibility, and sensitivity to biochemical signals \cite{tanMixedIonicElectronic2022}. 

%\begin{figure}[ht]

%\end{figure}


\subsection{Device Physics} \label{subsec:devphy}

Although the structural configuration of OECTs differs from conventional metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), understanding the operation of the latter can provide insight into how OECTs function. In contrast to MOSFETs, where an insulator is used, OECTs are coupled with an electrolyte, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:vsMOS}. When a gate voltage is applied, instead of polarizing the dipoles in the insulator and creating a field that causes accumulation of carriers at the interface of the semiconductor/insulator, as is the case with MOSFETs, in OECTs, the gate voltage drives ions to penetrate the bulk of the channel. Consequently, accumulation of carriers occurs throughout the whole volume of the OMIEC film. This mechanism explains the large gate-channel capacitance observed in these devices compared to MOSFETs and why the drain current takes into account a volumetric capacitance \cite{friedleinDevicePhysicsOrganic2018}.


\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/pdf/MOSFETvsOECTs.pdf}
  \caption[Device physics of MOSFET vs OECT]{Comparison of p-type A) MOSFET and B) OECT, where the light-gray region represents an insulator and a electrolyte, respectively. Extracted from reference  \cite{friedleinDevicePhysicsOrganic2018}}
  \label{fig:vsMOS}
\end{figure}

Bernards and Malliaras implemented a model based on a p-type depletion-mode OECT (based on PEDOT:PSS as it is widely studies and fabricated material, further discussion in the following section). The model divides the behavior of the OECT into two circuits: an electronic circuit (comprising the source-channel-gate structure) and an ionic circuit (comprising the gate-electrolyte-channel structure).

The electronic circuit is treated as a \textit{variable} resistor and is thus modeled using Ohm's law. Its variability arises from the fact that when a positive gate voltage is applied, de-doping of the semiconductor occurs, which is analogous to the compensation doping observed in silicon. Cations from the electrolyte penetrate the polymer, compensating for an acceptor. 

Meanwhile, the ionic circuit consists of a resistor that represents the flow of ions in the electrolyte, connected in series with a capacitor representing the storage of ions in the channel, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bernard}B  \cite{rivnayOrganicElectrochemicalTransistors2018}\cite{bernardsSteadyStateTransientBehavior2007}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\label{fig:bernard}
\end{figure}

Finally, the drain current $I_{D}$ for the steady state behavior of the OECT can now be described using the following equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:id}
	I_{D} = \begin{dcases*}
    -\mu C^{*} [\frac{Wd}{L}\frac{V_{GS}-V_{Th}^{2}}{2V_{Th}}] & \text{$|V_{DS}| < |V_{GS}|-|V_{Th}|$} \\
    -\mu C^{*} \frac{Wd}{L} [1 - \frac{V_{GS}-1/2 V_{DS}}{V_{Th}}] V_{DS} & \text{$|V_{DS}| > |V_{GS}|-|V_{Th}|$}
    \end{dcases*}
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ is the charge mobility, C* is the volumetric capacitance and W, d and L are the width, thickness and length of the channel. $V_{GS}$, $V_{DS}$ and $V_{Th}$ correspond to the gate, drain and threshold voltage, respectively. Parameters will be further discuss in Section \ref{OECT:fom}.  

\subsection{Operation Modes}

Analogous to conventional MOSFETs, depending on whether the device requires a gate potential to be turned ON, OECTs exhibit two operation modes: depletion and enhancement (the latter often referred to as accumulation in the context of OECTs). The operation modes are closely linked to the nature of the channel material%if it is inherently conductive or semiconducting
.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\subfloat[Depletion-mode OECT]{{\includegraphics[height=7cm]{Images/pdf/depletion.pdf} }}

	\caption[Depletion- and accumulation-mode OECTs]{(A) Transfer curve showing depletion-mode operation of a p-type OECT with a conducting polymer channel. (B) Transfer curve showing accumulation-mode operation of a p-type OECT with a insulating polymer channel. Images extracted from reference \cite{rivnayOrganicElectrochemicalTransistors2018}.}
	\label{fig:modes}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:modes}A and B, the polymer can be either intrinsically doped (conductive) or undoped (insulating). In the first scenario, the OMIEC already possesses anions that induce charges within its backbone. Consequently, to turn off the device, cations need to be injected to counteract this effect. Conversely, for an insulating polymer channel, a zero-gate biased OECT will have no charges induced in its backbone, resulting in the OFF state. To transition to the ON state, a gate voltage is required to drive anions into the polymer and induce charges.

\subsubsection{Standard material for depletion-mode OECTs}

Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a \textit{``degenerately doped''} \cite{bernardsSteadyStateTransientBehavior2007} or conductive polymer that is widely used in various applications in organic electronics. Classified as type I OMIEC, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:omiectypes}, it is a blend between a conjugated polymer (PEDOT) and a polyelectrolyte (PSS), the latter possesses chemically linked ions and serves as a polymeric acid template to allow dispersable suspensions \cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}.

Due to its commercial availability, operational stability, and relatively high performance, PEDOT:PSS became a standard material for p-type OECTs. However, its main drawback lays in its depletion-mode operation.

With the aim of minimizing power consumption, there is a strong interest in fabricating high-performance accumulation-mode devices \cite{nielsenMolecularDesignSemiconducting2016}\cite{tanOrganicMixedIonic2022}\cite{inalBenchmarkingOrganicMixed2017}\cite{keeneEnhancementModePEDOTPSS2020}. These devices offer the advantage of dissipating less static power when the device is not in operation, due to low OFF current %, which must be minimized as much as possible
\cite{giovannittiEnergeticControlRedoxActive2020}.

\subsubsection{Prospective materials for accumulation-mode OECTs}
% As a widely studied material, 
PEDOT:PSS has not been ruled out as a possible accumulation-mode OECT, Keene et al. employed a series of amines to de-dope PEDOT:PSS and achieve OECTs with negative turn-on voltages \cite{keeneEnhancementModePEDOTPSS2020}. However, synthetically modifying PEDOT:PSS in a controlled manner remains a challenge. 

In parallel to these efforts, researchers are also working on the design of new conjugated polymers with the aim of not only having accumulation-mode OECTs but enhancing their performance. Nielsen et al. reported a series of semiconducting polymers with triethylene glycol (TEG) side chains, some of which demonstrated good performance. Among the five thiophene- and benzodithiophene-based polymers, they found out that the one with a %TEGylated 
backbone consisting of 2,2'-bithiophene (blue) polymerized with other thiophene molecule (green), named as \textbf{g2T-T}, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:g2TT}, exhibited the highest performance %, even higher transconductance over PEDOT:PSS
\cite{nielsenMolecularDesignSemiconducting2016}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\label{fig:g2TT}
\end{figure}

Moser et al. conducted a study using the same backbone (g2T-T) to investigate the impact of the length of the ethylene glycol (EG) side chain on the performance of OECTs 
\cite{moserEthyleneGlycolBasedSide2020}. They found that reducing the side chain length maximized both the capacitance and mobility of the OECTs. However, shorter side chain were less favorable for ion-polymer interaction. 

Their research suggested an optimum-side-chain length of 3 monomers, compared to 2, 4 and 6 monomer. OECTs based on 3-(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy) thiophene (p(g3T2-T)) exhibited a turn-on voltage close to zero and superior performance compared to other thiophene-based species (as seen in Figure \ref{fig:pg3t} and Table \ref{tab:perf}), even surpassing PEDOT:PSS-based OECTs \cite{inalBenchmarkingOrganicMixed2017}. %. This advantage does not remain the only one, since p(g3T2-T)  would not require extensive pre- and postprocessing to optimize stability and electrochemical performance in aqueous media as PEDOT:PSS

The structural tuning of the polymer was designed to have a backbone that warrants reversibility during electrochemical redox reactions and good electronic transport, while the side chains enhance its stability in aqueous electrolytes and facilitate efficient transport of both ionic and electronic charge carrier \cite{moiaDesignEvaluationConjugated2019}.

Wheareas, PEDOT:PSS contains ions that are \textbf{chemically linked} to the polyelectrolyte (PSS). This structural distinction results in p(g3T2-T) displaying larger magnitudes of ionic-electronic coupling and volumetric capacitance compared to biphasic OMIECs like PEDOT:PSS \cite{paulsenOrganicMixedIonic2020}.

\subsection{Important Figures of Merit} \label{OECT:fom}

\subsubsection{Transconductance}
Transconductance is considered as the most important parameter for measuring the amplification capability of any transistor. It is calculated as the first-order derivative of the output current (drain current) with respect to the input voltage (gate-source voltage), expressed as $g_{m} = \sfrac{\partial I_{D}}{\partial V_{GS}}$. Bernards and Malliaras derived this parameter in their mathematical model for depletion-mode p-type OECTs \cite{bernardsSteadyStateTransientBehavior2007}, as discussed in Section \ref{subsec:devphy}. When considering both n-type and p-type OECTs, the transconductance can be expressed as follows: %\ref{eq:gm}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gm}
	g_{m} = \frac{Wd}{L} \mu C^{*} |(V_{th} - V_{G})|,
\end{equation}

where $W$, $L$ and $d$ are the channel width, length, and thickness, respectively, $\mu$C* denotes the product of mobility and volumetric capacitance, while $V_{G}$ and $V_{th}$ stand for the gate voltage and threshold voltage, which will be further discussed in the following subsections.

Typically, the maximum transconductance ($g_{m,max}$) is reported, which falls into the saturation regime. Inal et al. reported the maximum transconductance for various channel materials with different device geometry parameters. They used an Ag/AgCl pellet as reference/gate electrode and 0.1M NaCl as electrolyte. Their results showed that OECTs with polymerized g2T backbones exhibited the best performance, achieving transconductance values ranging from 1 to 30 mS, depending on the geometry (Figure \ref{fig:gmuc}A) \cite{inalBenchmarkingOrganicMixed2017}.

\subsubsection{$\mu$C* product}

The parameter $\mu$C* is considered the most important for benchmarking OECT channel materials because it represents both the ionic and electronic transport properties %storage ability
\cite{inalBenchmarkingOrganicMixed2017}. %\cite{inalHighTransconductanceAccumulation2014}. %% Other accumulation mode OECT with PTHS
It is the product of two important parameters, $\mu$, the electronic mobility, and C*, the volumetric capacitance, the latter encloses the ion penetration, transport, and storage ability of the OMIEC film.

Along with the transconductance, Inal et al. determined the values of $\mu$C* by calculating the linear slope of the maximum transconductance and channel geometry (Figure \ref{fig:gmuc}A), using Equation \ref{eq:gm}. They correlated their results with independent calculations of both parameters and found that polymerized g2T backbones exhibited the highest $\mu$C* value of 261 $\pm$ 29 $Fcm^{-1}V^{-1}s^{-1}$. Among the materials that showed a close 1:1 relationship for both methods of calculation of the $\mu$C* product, polymerized g2T backbones stood out (Figure \ref{fig:gmuc}B) \cite{inalBenchmarkingOrganicMixed2017}.

Calculating the electronic mobility ($\mu$) independently is challenging due to the presence of ionic species. This calculation is normally performed in transient regimes, taking advantage of ions' lower mobility, but it is outside the scope of this work. 

One method to calculate the volumetric capacitance (C*) is by performing Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Equation \ref{eq:C} is used to calculate the capacitance (C) based on the imaginary part of impedance ($Z^{img}$) at low frequency ranges where the capacitance should describe a plateau. %,since the modulation of AC is slow enough to fully populate the OMIEC with ions.
The calculated capacitance is then divided by the film volume to obtain C* %. Another approach is to use cyclic voltammetry (CV)
 \cite{ohayonGuideCharacterizationOrganic2023}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:C}
	C = \frac{1}{2\pi \cdot f \cdot |Z^{img}|},
\end{equation}

%The calculation of this capacitance is under a fixed-gate biased condition, 
It is important to note that the capacitance (C) can be potential-dependent when electrochemical doping is modulated in OECTs with an applied bias %. Homogeneous single phase OMIECs (type V and VI) display larger magnitudes of ionic-electronic coupling and larger values of volumetric capacitance than biphasic OMIECs such as PEDOT:PSS 
\cite{inalBenchmarkingOrganicMixed2017}.

\subsubsection{Threshold voltage}

The threshold voltage ($V_{th}$) in an OECT can be determined from the steady-state transfer characteristics ($I_{D}$ vs $V_{GS}$). To calculate $V_{th}$, you can plot the square root of $I_{D}$ as a function of $V_{GS}$ and extrapolate the linear portion of the slope, where it intersects the x-axis. This value of $V_{th}$ represents the \textit{``film's readiness for ion penetration''} in OECTs \cite{ohayonGuideCharacterizationOrganic2023}.

Controlling or shifting the threshold voltage is desirable, specially for integrating transistors into circuits to meet specific requirements for operation, noise margins, and power consumption. There are different approaches to achieve this. One approach is the chemical de-doping of PEDOT:PSS, as discussed in previous sections, which can shift the threshold voltage to negative values characteristic of accumulation-mode OECTs \cite{keeneEnhancementModePEDOTPSS2020}. 

 \begin{figure}[ht]

	\subfloat[]{{\includegraphics[width=5.8cm]{Images/pdf/wf_shift.pdf} }}

	\label{fig:tune}
\end{figure}

Another approach, explored by Tan et al., involves tuning the doping level of the gate to shift the threshold voltage. They used p(g3T2-T) and achieved a 400 mV change in threshold voltage with a 60\% molar ratio of %2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (
F$_{4}$TCNQ dopant, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tune}. This approach offers advantages such as i) protecting the material from oxidation by bringing the Fermi level towards the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and ii) avoiding interference with the channel which helps to maintain the transconductance unaffected \cite{tanTuningOrganicElectrochemical2022}.


\subsection{Side Reactions} \label{subsec:sidereac}

%Achieving effective charge transfer between the analyte and OMIEC requires appropriate alignment of the electrochemical potential of electrons on the OMIEC electrode and the redox specie. Failure to do so may result in the subsequent transfer of charges to other redox-active sinks in the environment, leading to undesirable side reactions and products that may interfere with the OMIEC’s operation. Electrons flow from a region of higher to lower electrochemical potential. Hence, achieving electron transfer from redox-active species to the OMIEC requires the latter to have a deep LUMO (high electron affinity) \cite{tanMixedIonicElectronic2022} %paper

\subsubsection{Water uptake and swelling}

%Although there are some studies in non-water-based electrolytes, such as ionic liquids. 
Water uptake and swelling are important side reactions that occur when OMIECs come into contact with water-based electrolytes. Even in the pursuit of solid-state OECTs, precursors may contain a certain degree of water content  \cite{weissbachPhotopatternableSolidElectrolyte2022}\cite{nguyen-dangBiomaterialBasedSolidElectrolyteOrganic2021}, making it necessary to understand the impact of water-related side reactions. %and some bioelectronics applications will inevitable operate under water environment, 

Water uptake in OMIECs causes their increase of mass (swelling) and changes in morphology. This water uptake occurs because OMIECs need to compensate for their intrinsic doping, and as a result, \textit{``the effect of doping-induced hydration on the OMIEC morphology must be taken into account when designing OECTs''} \cite{savvaBalancingIonicElectronic2020}.

Savva et al. conducted an study to investigate the influence of water on the performance of PEDOT:PSS OECTs. They found that water uptake %of conjugated polymer films 
led to a 10-13\% increase in mass under non-biased conditions. Interestingly, the concentration of water played a role in the ionic charging rate. While lower concentrations of water (NaCl$_{aq}$ 10 mM, 100mM, 1M, and 6M) led to faster ionic charging, %regardless of the doping pulse, 
the fastest %ionic charging 
response time was achieved with NaCl$_{aq}$ 1 M. This was attributed to attractive forces between counter ions, which % the injection/drift of ions is also affected by the ion-counterion, attractive forces in NaCl$_{aq}$ 6 M 
hindered the drift of anions and delayed the injection of ions from the electrolyte %, opposing their drift into the polymer affecting the response time. %Water irreversibly changes the film morphology, In general, while ion transport is enhanced, electronic charge transport is negatively impacted 
\cite{savvaInfluenceWaterPerformance2019}.

%Swelling is produced due to the compensation doping in the film, the ratio of swelling is normally reported and calculating by measuring the length of  by estimating "the number of electrolyte ions compensating for the electronic charge carriers" in the OMIEC. \cite{ohayonGuideCharacterizationOrganic2023}. %Savva et al. demonstrated that polymers in contact with water and are used for enhancement mode OECTs detriment its electronic charge transport, since water irreversibly changes the film morphology, but at the same time enhances ion transport \cite{savvaInfluenceWaterPerformance2019}

%\subsubsection{Water uptake}
Another study by Savva et al. showed that a certain level of hydration is necessary for facile ionic transport, but can have a negative impact on electronic charge transport, particularly in glycol-based side chains \cite{savvaBalancingIonicElectronic2020}. These side chains are commonly used in accumulation-mode OECTs, where ionic transport is already enhanced through side-chain engineering \cite{moiaDesignEvaluationConjugated2019}. %increased its transconductance by five orders of magnitude, due to an increase in C* and charge carrier mobility. %\cite{siemons}


\subsubsection{Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR)}

The Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) is a common undesirable side reaction that occurs under environmental conditions, especially in devices fabricated with polymers having low ionization potential (IPs). The use of OMIECs with low IPs is frequent in accumulation-mode OECTs. 


%With the aim of developing accumulation-mode OECTs, the engineering of new OMIECs were introduced as commented in previous sections. Normally, this polymer backbones have low ionization potential (IPs) which lead to another side effect issue that little attention has been paid: non capacitive faradaic rections in ambient: electron-transfer reaction from the OMIEC to molecular oxygen described as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)

% Remember 
% Thermodynamically favored processes or reactions are those that involve both a decrease in the internal energy of the components (ΔH° < 0) and an increase in entropy of the components (ΔS° > 0). These processes are necessarily “thermodynamically favored” (ΔG° < 0) or negative. ΔG° = ΔH°-TΔS°
% Catalyst help to reduce the activation energy required for a reaction
The ORR is a non-capacitive faradaic reaction that takes place between the OMIEC and molecular oxygen, involving electron-transfer. This reaction can yield either hydrogen peroxide (H$_{2}$O$_{2}$) or water (H$_{2}$O), as described in \ref{eq:h2o2} and \ref{eq:h2o}, or it can result in the oxidation (p-doping) of the OMIEC which acts as the catalyst \cite{giovannittiEnergeticControlRedoxActive2020}. 

%The first shows a free energy difference that is endergonic for OMIECs with IPs > 4.9eV and hence prevent the OMIEC from undergoing ORR that form H$_{2}$O$_{2}$. To prevent the ORR in ambient conditions, OMIECs based on donor-acceptor copolymer (Type III or IV) that have large IPs to shift

% Actually this material does not avoid this, we need to take into account this interaction.


\begin{equation}\label{eq:h2o2}
	{E^{0}}_{O_{2}/H_{2}O_{2}} : O_{2} + 2H^{+} + 2e^{-} \rightarrow H_{2}O_{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:h2o}
	{E^{0}}_{O_{2}/H_{2}O} : O_{2} + 4H^{+} + 4e^{-} \rightarrow 2H_{2}O
\end{equation}

As represented in Figure \ref{fig:orr}, $\eta_{1}$ and $\eta_{2}$ represent the free energy difference between reactants and the reaction products H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O, respectively. If this free energy difference is negative, indicating that the reaction requires an energy input, the ORR is endergonic, while a positive free energy difference makes it exergonic (spontaneous). For instance, to prevent the formation of oxygen peroxide, a polymer with higher IP (> 4.9eV) would be required. 

In the context of OECTs, where polymers like PEDOT:PSS and p(g3T2-T) are used, it is important to recognize that these materials exhibit exergonic reactions under environmental conditions. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the impact of the ORR on device stability and performance, particularly in applications where long-term reliability is essential.
